/* At consensus, updates an already created token to the given values.

If no value is given for a field, that field is left unchanged. For an immutable tokens (that is, a token without an admin key), only the expiry may be updated. Setting any other field in that case will cause the transaction status to resolve to TOKEN_IS_IMMUTABLE.

--- Signing Requirements ---
1. Whether or not a token has an admin key, its expiry can be extended with only the transaction payer's signature.
2. Updating any other field of a mutable token requires the admin key's signature.
3. If a new admin key is set, this new key must sign <b>unless</b> it is exactly an empty <tt>KeyList</tt>. This special sentinel key removes the existing admin key and causes the token to become immutable. (Other <tt>Key</tt> structures without a constituent <tt>Ed25519</tt> key will be rejected with <tt>INVALID_ADMIN_KEY</tt>.)
4. If a new treasury is set, the new treasury account's key must sign the transaction. */
