/**
 * A Block Item for record files.
 *
 * A `RecordFileItem` contains data produced before the innovation of the
 * Block Stream, when data was stored in files and validated by individual
 * signature files rather than a block proof.<br/>
 * This item enables a single format, the Block Stream, to carry both
 * historical and current data; eliminating the need to search two sources for
 * block and block chain data.<br/>
 * Any block containing this item requires special handling.
 * - The block SHALL have a `BlockHeader`.
 *    - Some fields in the `BlockHeader` may be interpreted differently, and
 *      may depend on when the original record file was created.
 * - The block SHALL NOT have a `BlockProof`.
 * - The block SHALL end with an `AddressBookProof`, which is only used for
 *   `RecordFileItem` blocks.
 * - The block SHALL contain _exactly one_ `RecordFileItem`.
 * - The block SHALL NOT contain any content item other than a `RecordFileItem`.
 * - The content of the `RecordFileItem` MUST be validated using the
 *   signature data and content provided herein according to the
 *   process used for Record Files prior to the creation of Block Stream.
 *    - This block item only replaces the requirement to read several
 *      individual files from cloud storage services.
 * - The address book relevant to a particular record file SHALL be available
 *   separately as an `AddressBookProof` item.
