// There is no message for `uncheckedSubmit`; that transaction is handled by
// workflow *before* consensus. Only the wrapped transaction is submitted to
// consensus, and that is what will appear in the block stream.  Also,
// `uncheckedSubmit` MUST NOT ever be enabled in any public network
// (i.e. previewnet, testnet, mainnet).
