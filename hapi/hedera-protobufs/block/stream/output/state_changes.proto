/**
 * # State Changes
 * Serialization of change records which describe the mutation of state
 * during a block.
 *
 * The _ordered_ application of all `StateChanges` in a block to an initial
 * state that matches network state at the beginning of that block MUST produce
 * a resultant state that matches the network state at the end of that block.
 *
 * > REVIEW NOTE
 * >> We have quite a few very large bytes values in state (e.g. files,
 * >> contracts, etc..). Would it be worthwhile to store changes to a bytes
 * >> value as a simplified difference set? Would it be worthwhile to do the
 * >> same for repeated items (perhaps only when over some threshold in length)?
 * >> This might also help with things like the 0.0.98 problem, because we
 * >> could record an empty difference set for the large repeated items.
 * >
 * >> Another thought. Protobuf is pretty good at optimizing a difference/merge
 * >> entry for a protobuf encoded message. Could we perhaps only write changed
 * >> fields for state mutations and apply those changed fields to the existing
 * >> entity to recreate the modified state?
 *
