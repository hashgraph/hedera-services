 * queue appends. To say which state the change is on we will include an
 * `integer` number for the state name. This is done for performance and
 * efficiency as there will be 10s of thousands of state changes in a block.
 *
 * We use an integer, and provide this enumeration, for the following reasons.
 * - If we have a extra 8-10 bytes per state change at 40-50K state changes
 *   per second then that is an extra 2.5-4 megabits of bandwidth. Compression
 *   should help a lot but that is not guaranteed.
 * - When the state name is used as part of complex key in the big state
 *   merkle map. The smaller the key is, in bytes, the more efficient the
 *   database is, because more keys can fit in a single disk page.
 * - When parsing keys, parsing a UTF-8 string to a Java String is a many
 *   times more expensive than parsing a VARINT to an integer.
 *
 * Note: This enumeration is never transmitted directly in the block stream.
 * This enumeration is provided for clients to _interpret_ the value
 * of the `StateChange`.`state_id` field.
