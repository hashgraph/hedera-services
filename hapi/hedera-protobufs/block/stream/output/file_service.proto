/**
 * # File Service
 * Block stream messages that report the results of transactions handled
 * by the `File` service.
 *
 * A `file` in Hedera is an arbitrary sequence of bytes and may be up to
 * `1048576` total bytes. Files are used anywhere a transaction requires a
 * large amount of data (anything that would not fit within the
 * transaction size limit).
 *
 * Examples
 *  - smart contract bytecode
 *  - network configuration updates
 *  - network fee schedules
 *  - image files for NFTs
 *  - property title documents
 * There are many other uses; these examples are illustrative.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in
 * [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
 * [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
