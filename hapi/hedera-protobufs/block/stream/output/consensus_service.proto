/**
 * # Consensus Service
 * Block stream messages that report the results of transactions handled
 * by the `Consensus` service.
 *
 * ### Topic Running Hash Calculation
 * Submitted messages include a topic running hash. This value has changed
 * over time, with the known versions detailed in the `RunningHashVersion`
 * enumeration. The running hash version SHALL NOT be transmitted in the
 * Block Stream, however, as it is a fixed value that can only be changed
 * with a new release of consensus node software following a HIP to update
 * the specification, so repeating that fixed value in the block stream is
 * wasteful and unnecessary.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in
 * [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
 * [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
