/**
 * # Block Item
 * A single item in the block stream, such as transaction data, event metadata,
 * or a a system transaction.<br/>
 * Each block consists of a block header, one or more block items,
 * and a block state proof. Within the block are a series of events delimited
 * by start_event block items.
 *
 * This structure here MUST support a stream of block items with no enclosing
 * message.<br/>
 * Implementations SHOULD behave in a reasonable manner if used in a gRPC
 * bidirectional streaming RPC similar to
 * `rpc processBlocks(stream BlockItem) returns (stream Acknowledgement);`.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in
 * [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
 * [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).

/**
 * A single item within a block stream.
 *
 * Each item in the block stream SHALL be self-contained and independent,
 * with the following constraints applicable to the _unfiltered_ stream.
 * - A block SHALL start with a `header`.
 * - A block SHALL end with a `state_proof`.
 * - A `block_header` SHALL be followed by an `event_header`.
 * - An `event_header` SHALL be followed by one or more
 *   `event_transaction` items.
 * - An `event_transaction` SHALL be followed by a `transaction_result`.
 * - A `transaction_result` MAY be followed by a `transaction_output`.
 * - A `transaction_result` (or a `transaction_output`, if present) MAY be
 *     followed by one or more `state_changes`.
 *
 * This forms the following required sequence for each block, which is then
 * repeated within the block stream, indefinitely.  Note that there is no
 * container structure in the stream, the indentation below is only to
 * highlight repeated subsequences.<br/>
 * The order of items within each block below is REQUIRED and SHALL NOT change.
 *
 * ```text
 * header
 *   repeated {
 *     start_event
 *     repeated {
 *       event_transaction
 *       transaction_result
 *       (optional) transaction_output
 *       (optional) repeated state_changes
 *     }
 *   }
 * state_proof
 * ```
 * A filtered stream may exclude some items above, depending on filter
 * criteria. A filtered item is replaced with a merkle path and hash value
 * to maintain block stream verifiability.
 *
 * A BlockItem SHALL be individually and directly processed to create the
 * item hash.<br/>
 * Items to be hashed MUST NOT be contained within another item.<br/>
 * Items which might be filtered out of the stream MUST NOT be
 * contained in other items.
 *
 * ### Forward Compatibility
 * In order to maximize forward compatibility, and minimize the need to
 * coordinate deployments of different systems creating and processing
 * block streams in the future, the following rules SHALL be followed
 * for field numbering in this message.
 * - The first 15 field numbers SHALL be assigned to the fields present
 *   in the first release. Unused fields in this range SHALL remain reserved
 *   until needed for additional options that do not fit into "input" or
 *   "output" categories.
 * - Fields numbered 16 and above MUST be numbered as follows.
 *    - "input" items MUST use `odd` field numbers.
 *    - "output" items MUST use `even` field numbers.
 *
 * #### Forward Compatibility Example
 * A future update adding three new items. A "BlockTrailer" item which is
 * neither input nor output, a new "ConsensusTransom" which is an input,
 * and a new "BridgeTransform" which is an output.
 * - The "BlockTrailer" is field 11, which is removed from the `reserved` list.
 * - The "ConsensusTransom" is an input, so it is field `17` (the first unused
 *   `odd` field greater than or equal to 16).
 * - The "BridgeTransform" is an output, so it is field `16` (the first unused
 *   even field greater than or equal to 16).
 *
 * #### Initial Field assignment to "input", "output", and "other" categories.
 * - Inputs
 *    - `event_header`
 *    - `round_header`
 *    - `event_transaction`
 * - Outputs
 *    - `block_header`
 *    - `transaction_result`
 *    - `transaction_output`
 *    - `state_changes`
 * - Any subtree (depending on what was filtered).
 *   This item details it's path in the tree.
 *    - `filtered_item_hash`
 * - Neither input nor output (and not part of the "proof" merkle tree)
 *    - `block_proof`
 *    - `record_file`
