/**
 * # Block Item
 * A single item in the block stream, such as transaction data, event metadata,
 * or a a system transaction.<br/>
 * Each block consists of a block header, one or more block items,
 * and a block state proof. Within the block are a series of events delimited
 * by start_event block items.
 *
 * This structure here MUST support a stream of block items with no enclosing
 * message.<br/>
 * Implementations SHOULD behave in a reasonable manner if used in a gRPC
 * bidirectional streaming RPC similar to
 * `rpc processBlocks(stream BlockItem) returns (stream Acknowledgement);`.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in
 * [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
 * [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).

/**
 * A single item within a block stream.
 *
 * Each item in the block stream SHALL be self-contained and independent,
 * with the following constraints applicable to the _unfiltered_ stream.
 * - A block SHALL start with a `header`.
 * - A block SHALL end with a `state_proof`.
 * - A `header` SHALL be followed by a `start_event`.
 * - A `start_event` SHALL be followed by one or more `system_transaction`
 *   or `transaction` items.
 * - A `transaction` SHALL be followed by a `transaction_result`.
 * - A `transaction_result` MAY be followed by a `transaction_output`.
 * - A `transaction_result` (or a `transaction_output`, if present) MAY be
 *     followed by one or more `state_changes`.
 *
 * This forms the following required sequence for each block, which is then
 * repeated within the block stream, indefinitely.  Note that there is no
 * container structure in the stream, the indentation below is only to
 * highlight repeated subsequences.<br/>
 * The order of items within each block below is REQUIRED and SHALL NOT change.
 *
 * ```text
 * header
 *   repeated {
 *     start_event
 *     repeated {
 *       (optional) repeated system_transaction
 *       (optional) transaction
 *       (optional) transaction_result
 *       (optional) transaction_output
 *       (optional) repeated state_changes
 *     }
 *   }
 * state_proof
 * ```
 * A filtered stream may exclude some items above, depending on filter
 * criteria. A filtered item is replaced with its merkle path to maintain
 * block stream verifiability.
 *
 * A BlockItem SHALL be individually and directly processed to create the
 * running hash. Items to be hashed MUST NOT be contained within another
 * item, and items which might be filtered out of the stream MUST NOT be
 * contained in other items.
