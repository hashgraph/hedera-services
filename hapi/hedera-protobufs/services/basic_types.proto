/**
 * # Basic Types
 * Fundamental message types used across transactions and state as field types.
 *
 * ### Requirements for identifier values
 * - Most entities in the network SHALL be identified by a multi-part
 *   identifier. These identifier values SHALL consist of a shard, a realm, and
 *   an entity identifier.
 * - Shard, Realm, and Entity Number MUST all be whole numbers.
 * - A Shard SHALL be globally unique.
 * - A Realm MAY be reused between shards, but SHALL be unique within a shard.
 * - An Entity Number MAY be reused between shards and realms, but SHALL be
 *   unique within each combination of shard and realm.
 * - Every object (e.g. account, file, token, etc...) SHALL be scoped to exactly
 *   one realm and shard. Thus a File has a FileID, a numeric triplet, such as
 *   0.0.2 for shard 0, realm 0, entity 2.
 * - Identifier values SHOULD use an Entity Number as the third component of the
 *   identifier. Some, however, MAY use alternative or composite values for the
 *   Entity portion of the three part identifier. Any such alternative or
 *   composite value MUST be unique within that shard and realm combination.
 * - The entity portion of the identifier, regardless of type, MUST be unique
 *   within that realm and shard combination and MAY be globally unique.
 * - The triplet of shard.realm.entity MUST be globally unique, even across
 *   different identifier types.
 * - Each realm SHALL maintain a single counter for entity numbers, so if there
 *   is an identifier with value 0.1.2, then there MUST NOT be an identifier
 *   with value 0.1.2 for any other object.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in
 * [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119) and clarified in
 * [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).

 * known, or in some smart contracts that use the EVM address style alias to
 * refer to Accounts.<br/>
 * When the account entry is completed, the alias SHALL be stored separately in
 * the Account record, and the identifier in the Account SHALL use the
 * `accountNum` form.
 *
 * ---
 * ### Additional Notes
 *
 * #### Alias
 * There is considerable complexity with `alias` (aka `evm_address`) for
 * Accounts. Much of this comes from the existence of a "hidden" alias for
 * almost all accounts, and the reuse of the alias field for both EVM reference
 * and "automatic" account creation.<br/>
 * For the purposes of this specification, we will use the following terms for
 * clarity.
 *   - `key_alias`<br/>
 *      The account public key as a protobuf serialized message and used for
 *      auto-creation and subsequent lookup. This is only valid if the account
 *      key is a single `primitive` key, either Ed25519 or ECDSA_SECP256K1.
 *   - `evm_address`<br/>
 *     Exists for every account and is one of
 *      - `contract_address`<br/>
 *        The 20 byte EVM address prescribed by `CREATE` or `CREATE2`
 *      - `evm_key_address`<br/>
 *        An arbitrary 20 byte EVM address that, for a usable externally owned
 *        account (EOA) SHALL be the rightmost 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash
 *        of a ECDSA_SECP256K1 key.<br/>
 *        Such accounts may be created in one of three ways:
 *        - Sending hbar or fungible tokens to an unused
 *          ECDSA_SECP256K1 key alias.
 *        - Sending hbar or fungible tokens to an unassigned 20-byte
 *          EVM address.
 *        - Submitting a `CryptoCreate` signed with the corresponding
 *          private key.
 *      - `long_zero`<br/>
 *        A synthetic 20 byte address inferred for "normally" created accounts.
 *        It is constructed from the "standard" AccountID as follows.
 *         1. 4 byte big-endian shard number
 *         1. 8 byte big-endian realm number
 *         1. 8 byte big-endian entity number<br/>
 *
 * The `alias` field in the `Account` message SHALL contain one of four values
 * for any given account.
 *   - The `key_alias`, if the account was created by transferring HBAR to the
 *     `key_alias` public key value.
 *   - The `evm_key_address` if the account was created from an EVM public key
 *   - The `contract_address` if the account belongs to an EVM contract
 *   - Not-Set/null/Bytes.EMPTY (collectively `null`) if the account was
 *     created normally
 *
 * If the `alias` field of an `Account` is any form of `null`, then the account
 * MAY be referred to by `alias` in an `AccountID` by using the `long_zero`
 * address for the account.<br/>
 * This "hidden default" alias SHALL NOT be stored, but is synthesized by the
 * node software as needed, and may be synthesized by an EVM contract or client
 * software as well.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * #### Alias forms
 * An `AccountID` in a transaction MAY reference an `Account` with
 * `shard.realm.alias`.<br/>
 * If the account `alias` field is set for an Account, that value SHALL be the
 * account alias.<br/>
 * If the account `alias` field is not set for an Account, the `long_zero` alias
 * SHALL be the account alias.

 * TransactionID. Then, the transaction will take effect when the first of all
 * those nodes submits the transaction and it reaches consensus. The other

 * for example, network connectivity will not affect all nodes equally. Latency
 * might be slightly lower, if one node is handling intake significantly slower
 * than others, for example. The base transaction fee is required for each
 * submission, however, so the total fees charged are significantly higher when
 * using this approach.

/**
 * A Key is an entity representing one or more cryptographic public/private key
 * pairs and, optionally, the structure for how multiple signatures may be
 * composed to meet complex multiple-signature authorization requirements.
 *
 * A Key can be a public key from either the Ed25519 or ECDSA(secp256k1)
 * signature schemes. In the ECDSA(secp256k1) case we require the 33-byte
 * compressed form of the public key. For simplicity, we call these
 * cryptographic public keys `primitive` keys.<br/>
 * If an entity has a primitive key associated to it, then the corresponding
 * private key must sign any transaction to send tokens or perform other
 * actions requiring authorization.
 *
 * A Key can also be the ID of a smart contract, which SHALL authorize that
 * contract to execute any system contract with signing requirements that are
 * met by the key.<br/>
 * > Example
 * >> If account `0.0.A` has a threshold key whose threshold is satisfied
 * >> by a contract ID key for contract `0.0.C`, then when `0.0.C` is called,
 * >> it is authorized to use system contracts to manage any asset owned by
 * >> `0.0.A`. If the contract ID key is "delegatable", then `0.0.C` can even
 * >> perform these actions when running code accessed via `DELEGATECALL`.
 *
 * A Key can be a "threshold key", which is a list of N keys, any M of which
 * may sign in order for the signature to be considered valid. The value of
 * M for a given threshold key MUST be less than or equal to N. A threshold
 * key is sometimes called a "M-of-N" key.
 *
 * A Key can be a "key list" where all keys in the list must sign unless
 * specified otherwise in the documentation for a specific transaction
 * type (e.g. FileDeleteTransactionBody).<br/>
 * This implies that the use of a key list is dependent on context. For
 * example, an Hedera file that is created with a list of keys, SHALL require
 * that all of those keys must sign a transaction to create or modify the file,
 * but only one key from that list MUST sign a transaction to delete the file.
 * So it is a single list that sometimes acts as a N-of-N threshold key, and
 * sometimes acts as a 1-of-N threshold key.<br/>
 * To reduce confusion this may cause, a key list SHALL always be considered
 * N-of-N, unless specified otherwise in official documentation.<br/>
 * A key list MAY have repeated primitive public keys, but the signature
 * requirement for all keys in a repeated set SHALL be satisfied by a single
 * valid signature. There is no mechanism to require a single key to sign a
 * single transaction more than once.
 *
 * Any list or threshold key MAY have nested key lists or threshold keys.
 * This allows, for example, the keys within a threshold signature to
 * themselves be threshold, list, contract, or primitive keys. This nesting
 * structure enables complex asymmetric multi-party signature requirements to
 * be met.
 *
 * To ensure adequate performance and transaction security, key nesting is
 * limited to at most fifteen(15) levels.
