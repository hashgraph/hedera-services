 * recipients, and the `net_of_transfers` flag is false, the network
 * SHALL attempt to evenly assess the total fee across all recipients
 * proportionally. This may be inexact and, particularly when there are
 * large differences between recipients, MAY result in small deviations
 * from an ideal "fair" distribution.<br/>
 * If the sender lacks sufficient tokens to pay fees, or the assessment
 * of custom fees reduces the net amount transferred to or below zero,
 * the transaction MAY fail due to insufficient funds to pay all fees.

 * > enforce _inescapable_ royalties on the exchange of a unique NFT.<br/>
 * > For _one_ example, if the counterparties agree to split their value
 * > transfer and NFT exchange into separate transactions, the network cannot
 * > possibly determine the value exchanged. Even trustless transactions,
 * > using a smart contract or other form of escrow, can arrange such split
 * > transactions as a single _logical_ transfer.
 *

 * pattern the network recognizes.

 * transfers the NFT from sender to receiver, debits the fungible value from
 * the receiver, and credits the sender with the fungible value the receiver
 * is exchanging for the NFT.<br/>
 * A marketplace using an approved spender account for an escrow transaction
 * MUST credit the account selling the NFT in the same `cryptoTransfer`
 * transaction that transfers the NFT to, and deducts fungible value from,
 * the buying account.
 * </div></div>
