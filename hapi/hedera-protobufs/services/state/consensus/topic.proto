 * Representation of an Hedera Consensus Service(HCS) topic.
 *
 * As with all network entities, a topic has a unique entity number, which is
 * usually given along with the network's shard and realm in the form of a
 * shard.realm.number id.<br/>
 * An HCS topic is an ordered logical stream of messages united and secured by
 * a running hash of those messages. The integrity of any message on a topic,
 * and the topic stream as a whole, can always be ascertained from block stream
 * data by recomputing the running hash across any subset of messages on the
 * topic.<br/>
 * The messages on a topic SHALL NOT be stored in network state, but are
 * available in the network block stream, and may be queried via the
 * Mirror Node system.
