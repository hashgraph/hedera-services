/**
 * Representation of a Hedera Consensus Service topic in the network Merkle tree.
 * 
 * As with all network entities, a topic has a unique entity number, which is usually given along 
 * with the network's shard and realm in the form of a shard.realm.number id.
 * 
 * A topic consists of just two pieces of data:
 *   1. The total number of messages sent to the topic; and,
 *   2. The running hash of all those messages.
 * It also has several metadata elements:
 *   1. A consensus expiration time in seconds since the epoch.
 *   2. (Optional) The number of an auto-renew account, in the same shard and realm as the topic, that 
 *   has signed a transaction allowing the network to use its balance to automatically extend the topic's 
 *   expiration time when it passes.
 *   3. The number of seconds the network should automatically extend the topic's expiration by, if the 
 *   topic has a valid auto-renew account, and is not deleted upon expiration.
 *   4. A boolean marking if the topic has been deleted.
 *   5. A memo string whose UTF-8 encoding is at most 100 bytes.
 *   6. (Optional) An admin key whose signature must be active for the topic's metadata to be updated.
 *   7. (Optional) A submit key whose signature must be active for the topic to receive a message.
 *   8. (Optional) A fee schedule key whose signature must be active for the topic's custom fees to be updated.
 *   9. (Optional) A list of keys that can submit messages without paying custom fees.
 *   10. (Optional) A list of custom fees to be assessed for each message submitted to the topic.
