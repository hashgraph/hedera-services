/**
 * Create a topic to accept and group consensus messages.
 *
 * If `autoRenewAccount` is specified, that account Key MUST also sign this
 * transaction.<br/>
 * If `adminKey` is set, that Key MUST sign the transaction.<br/>
 * On success, the resulting `TransactionReceipt` SHALL contain the newly
 * created `TopicId`.
 *
 * The `autoRenewPeriod` on a topic MUST be set to a value between
 * `autoRenewPeriod.minDuration` and `autoRenewPeriod.maxDuration`. These
 * values are configurable, typically 30 and 92 days.<br/>
 * This also sets the initial expirationTime of the topic.
 *
 * If no `adminKey` is set on a topic
 *   -`autoRenewAccount` SHALL NOT be set on the topic.
 *   - A `deleteTopic` transaction SHALL fail.
 *   - An `updateTopic` transaction that only extends the expirationTime MAY
 *     succeed.
 *   - Any other `updateTopic` transaction SHALL fail.
 *
 * If the topic expires and is not automatically renewed, the topic SHALL enter
 * the `EXPIRED` state.
 *   - All transactions on the topic SHALL fail with TOPIC_EXPIRED
 *      - Except an updateTopic() call that only extends the expirationTime.
 *   - getTopicInfo() SHALL succeed, and show the topic is expired.
 * The topic SHALL remain in the `EXPIRED` state for a time determined by the
 * `autorenew.gracePeriod` (configurable, originally 7 days).<br/>
 * After the grace period, if the topic's expirationTime is not extended, the
 * topic SHALL be automatically deleted from state entirely, and cannot be
 * recovered or recreated.
