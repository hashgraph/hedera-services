/**
 * Update the metadata, and/or replace the content, of a file in the
 * Hedera File Service (HFS).
 *
 * Any field which is not set (i.e. is null) in this message, other than
 * `fileID`, SHALL be ignored.<br/>
 * If the `keys` list for the identified file is an empty `KeyList`, then
 * this message MUST NOT set any field except `expirationTime`.
 *
 * #### Signature Requirements
 * Every `Key` in the `keys` list for the identified file MUST sign this
 * transaction, if any field other than `expirationTime` is to be updated.<br/>
 * If the `keys` list for the identified file is an empty `KeyList` (because
 * this file was previously created or updated to have an empty `KeyList`),
 * then the file is considered immutable and this message MUST NOT set any
 * field except `expirationTime`.<br/>
 * See the [File Service](#FileService) specification for a detailed
 * explanation of the signature requirements for all file transactions.
 *
 * ### Block Stream Effects
 * None
