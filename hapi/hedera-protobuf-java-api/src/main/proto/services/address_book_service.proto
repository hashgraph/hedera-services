/**
 * The Address Book service provides the ability for Hedera network node
 * administrators to add, update, and remove consensus nodes. This addition,
 * update, or removal of a consensus node requires governing council approval,
 * but each node operator may update their own operational attributes without
 * additional approval, reducing overhead for routine operations.
 *
 * Most operations are `privileged operations` and require governing council
 * approval.
 *
 * ### For a node creation transaction.
 * - The node operator SHALL create a `createNode` transaction.
 *    - The node operator MUST sign this transaction with the `Key`
 *      set as the `admin_key` for the new `Node`.
 *    - The node operator SHALL deliver the signed transaction to the Hedera
 *      council representative.
 *    - The Hedera council representative SHALL arrange for council members to
 *      review and sign the transaction.
 *    - Once sufficient council members have signed the transaction, the
 *      Hedera council representative SHALL submit the transaction to the
 *      network.
 * - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node creation transaction the network
 *   software SHALL
 *    - Validate the threshold signature for the Hedera governing council
 *    - Validate the signature of the `Key` provided as the new `admin_key`
 *      for the `Node`.
 *    - Create the new node in state, this new node SHALL NOT be active in the
 *      network at this time.
 *    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
 *      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration and bring the
 *      new node to an active status within the network. The node to be added
 *      SHALL be active in the network following this upgrade.
 *
 * ### For a node deletion transaction.
 * - The node operator or Hedera council representative SHALL create a
 *   `deleteNode` transaction.
 *    - If the node operator creates the transaction
 *       - The node operator MUST sign this transaction with the `Key`
 *         set as the `admin_key` for the existing `Node`.
 *       - The node operator SHALL deliver the signed transaction to the Hedera
 *         council representative.
 *    - The Hedera council representative SHALL arrange for council members to
 *      review and sign the transaction.
 *    - Once sufficient council members have signed the transaction, the
 *      Hedera council representative SHALL submit the transaction to the
 *      network.
 * - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node deletion transaction the network
 *   software SHALL
 *    - Validate the signature for the Hedera governing council
 *    - Remove the existing node from network state. The node SHALL still
 *      be active in the network at this time.
 *    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
 *      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration and remove the
 *      node to be deleted from the network. The node to be deleted SHALL NOT
 *      be active in the network following this upgrade.
 *
 * ### For a node update transaction.
 * - The node operator SHALL create an `updateNode` transaction.
 *    - The node operator MUST sign this transaction with the active `key`
 *      assigned as the `admin_key`.
 *    - The node operator SHALL submit the transaction to the
 *      network.  Hedera council approval SHALL NOT be sought for this
 *      transaction
 * - Upon receipt of a valid and signed node update transaction the network
 *   software SHALL
 *    - If the transaction modifies the value of the "node account",
 *       - Validate the signature of the active `key` for the account
 *         assigned as the _current_ "node account".
 *       - Validate the signature of the active `key` for the account to be
 *         assigned as the _new_ "node account".
 *    - Modify the node information held in network state with the changes
 *      requested in the update transaction. The node changes SHALL NOT be
 *      applied to network configuration, and SHALL NOT affect network
 *      operation at this time.
 *    - When executing the next `freeze` transaction with `freeze_type` set to
 *      `PREPARE_UPGRADE`, update network configuration according to the
 *      modified information in network state. The requested changes SHALL
 *      affect network operation following this upgrade.
