/**
 * # System Delete
 * A system transaction to remove a file from the Hedera File
 * Service (HFS).<br/>
 * This transaction is a privileged operation restricted to "system"
 * accounts.
 *
 * > Note
 * >> System delete is defined here for a smart contract (to delete
 * >> the bytecode), but was never implemented.
 * >
 * >> Currently, system delete and system undelete specifying a smart
 * >> contract identifier SHALL return `INVALID_FILE_ID`
 * >> or `MISSING_ENTITY_ID`.

 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

 * Delete a file or contract bytecode as an administrative transaction.
 *
 * > Note
 * >> A system delete/undelete for a `contractID` is not supported and
 * >> SHALL return `INVALID_FILE_ID` or `MISSING_ENTITY_ID`.
 *
 * This transaction MAY be reversed by the `systemUndelete` transaction.
 * A file deleted via `fileDelete`, however SHALL be irrecoverable.<br/>
 * This transaction MUST specify an expiration timestamp (with seconds
 * precision). The file SHALL be permanently removed from state when
 * network consensus time exceeds the specified expiration time.<br/>
 * This transaction MUST be signed by an Hedera administrative ("system")
 * account.
 *
 * ### What is a "system" file
 * A "system" file is any file with a file number less than or equal to the
 * current configuration value for `ledger.numReservedSystemEntities`,
 * typically `750`.
 *
 * ### Block Stream Effects
 * None
