/**
 * Mark a token as deleted.<br/>
 * A deleted token remains present in the network state, but is no longer
 * active, cannot be held in a balance, and all operations on that token
 * fail. A deleted token is removed from network state when it expires.
 *
 * #### Operations on a deleted token
 * All operations on a deleted token SHALL fail with a
 * status code `TOKEN_WAS_DELETED`.<br/>
 * Any attempt to transfer a deleted token between accounts SHALL fail with
 * a status code `TOKEN_WAS_DELETED`.
 *
 * > QUESTIONS
 * >> What happens to existing balances/NFTs?
 * >> Are these removed; are they stuck on the accounts?
 * >
 * >> If balances/NFTs remain, can a `tokenReject` remove them?
 *
 * #### Requirements
 * The `admin_key` for the token MUST be set, and MUST
 * sign this transaction.<br/>
 * If the `admin_key` for the token is not set, this transaction SHALL
 * fail with a status code `TOKEN_IS_IMMUTABlE`.
 *
 * ### Block Stream Effects
 * None
