/**
 * Add signatures to an existing scheduled transaction.
 *
 * When a schedule _executes_ successfully, the receipt SHALL include a
 * `scheduledTransactionID` with the `TransactionID` of the transaction that
 * executed.<br/>
 * When a scheduled transaction is executed the network SHALL charge the
 * regular _service_ fee for the transaction to the `payerAccountID` for
 * that schedule, but SHALL NOT charge node or network fees.<br/>
 * If the `payerAccountID` field is not set, the effective `payerAccountID`
 * SHALL be the `payer` for this create transaction.<br/>
 * Each signature on this transaction SHALL "activate" the corresponding
 * cryptographic("primitive") key for the schedule identified.<br/>
 * Signature requirements SHALL be met when the set of active keys includes
 * all keys required by the scheduled transaction.<br/>
 * A scheduled transaction for a "long term" schedule SHALL NOT execute if
 * the signature requirements for that transaction are not met when the
 * network consensus time reaches the schedule `expiration_time`.<br/>
 * A "short term" schedule SHALL execute immediately once signature
 * requirements are met. This MAY be immediately when created.<br/>
 *
 * ### Block Stream Effects
 * If the scheduled transaction is executed immediately following this
 * `scheduleSign` transaction, the transaction record SHALL include a
 * `scheduleRef` with the schedule identifier `scheduleID`.
