/**
 * Mark a file as deleted and remove its content from network state.
 *
 * The metadata for a deleted file SHALL be retained at least until the
 * expiration time for the file is exceeded.<br/>
 * On completion, the identified file SHALL be marked `deleted`.<br/>
 * On completion, the identified file SHALL have an empty `contents` array.<br/>
 * This transaction SHALL be final and irreversible.<br/>
 *
 * #### Signature Requirements
 * At least _one_ key from the `KeyList` in the `keys` field of the
 * identified file MUST sign this transaction.<br/>
 * If the keys field for the identified file is an empty `KeyList` (because that
 * file was previously created or updated to have an empty `KeyList`), then the
 * file is considered immutable and this message SHALL fail as UNAUTHORIZED.
 * See the [File Service](#FileService) specification for a detailed
 * explanation of the signature requirements for all file transactions.
 *
 * ### What is a "system" file
 * A "system" file is any file with a file number less than or equal to the
 * current configuration value for `ledger.numReservedSystemEntities`,
 * typically `750`.
 *
 * ### Block Stream Effects
 * None
