/**
 * # State Common
 * Two older messages used in rare cases.
 * - EntityNumber is used to store The last used entity number in state, so
 *   that all entities in state have unique entity numbers, even across types.
 * - EntityIDPair is used to store a Token/Account pair in certain rare cases.
 *
 * Where possible, these messages SHOULD NOT be used.  A primitive `int64` or
 * `google.protobuf.Int64Value` wrapper is preferred instead of `EntityNumber
 * and `TokenAssociation` is preferred instead of `EntityIDPair`.
 *
 * ### Keywords
 * The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
 * "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
 * document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119)
 * and clarified in [RFC8174](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc8174).
