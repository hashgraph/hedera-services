## GCP setup

* `gcloud components update`
* `gcloud init` -- if needed
  * pick zone 'us-west1-c` -- arbitrarily (?)
* `gcloud auth application-default login` -- and sign in w/ account

## Python setup

* have `venv` available, install `3.12.0` (or something else recent)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * `pip install google-cloud-storage`
* `open /Applications/Python\ 3.12/Install\ Certificates.command`

## Get hostnames from `swirlds/infrastructure` repo

* see `mainnet/ansible/host_vars_mainnet/node*.yml`
* `grep source_hostname * | sed 's/[.]yml:source_hostname://g'`
* use file `mainnet_hostnames-2024-02-04.txt`

## To run:

First you use the script to create a file that contains the names of all the
stream files in the interval that are up there in Google Cloud Storage.
(And this file contains other date, such as the size of the file, and
whether or not it has been downloaded already.)

Then you use that file to download all the data files (which Google Cloud
Storage calls "blobs").

Easy.  Except due to cloud and network problems the smooth processing of
calls to Google Cloud Storage may get interrupted from time to time.  So the
script allows you to _rerun_ both phases until they're finally complete
(keeping track, via that file created in the first phase, of stuff that's
already been done, so it isn't done again.)

1. First create the list of blobs (record/event files) you want to download from gcp:

   ```bash
   python3 main.py get_blob_names -root <dir-for-files> \
                         -b <bloblist-filename>         \
                         -s <start-time> -e <end-time>  \
                         -node <node#>
   ```

   where the start and end of the interval are specified like `2024-02-01T00:00:00`,
   and the node number is the node you want to pull files for.

   This will tell you how many files it found in that interval.

   But it may happen the node you picked was down for some time during
   that interval.  So run the script again using the command `reget_blob_names`
   (instead of `get_blob_names`) and specify a different node number.  It
   will _merge_ additional files found into the bloblist you already
   have.  Repeat until it finds no new files.

2. Download the blobs with the command

   ```bash
   python3 main.py download_blobs -root <dir-for-files> \
                        -b <bloblist-filename>
   ```

   It will fetch files in batches - and give you a progress report on
   how many batches it is doing.

   Files can fail to download.  Keep repeating this command until you see,
   by the metrics reported, that all the files are downloaded.

   You can "tune" the performance by changing the batch size with the
   `-batch nnn` argument, and by changing the level of concurrency with the
   `-concurrency nnn` argument.

## More explanation

- What are all these "blobs" in the names of things in the source code?
  "Blob" is what Google Cloud Storage calls a "file".

- All nodes put the streams out on GCP, even though they're _identical_ (except for the
  signatures, of course).  So you can pick any node number (1..29) to pull
  from, your choice.  But sometimes nodes go down so the data is missing out
  there (without any indication).  So this script lets you _rerun_ getting the
  names of all the files, using a different node number ... you do that until
  no new files are discovered.  Then, presumably, you have a full set of
  stream file names.

  But the node you pull from doesn't matter.  And so the default chosen by
  the script, if you don't specify one, is arbitrary.

- Speaking of nodes, nodes are always referred to by their _number_ (1..
  29/30).  And that's true whether the script calls it a "number" or an "id" or
  whatever.

- This script - and I still think of it as a script - has grown a bit.  It
  might be a bit larger than a "script" now ... but there it is.  And so, even
  though it is not good software engineering to use _global variables_ this
  script does use global variables.  And since those global variables are
  referred to everywhere, even though it is not good software engineering to
  use _single character variable names **especially** for global variables_
  this script _does_ use single character variable names to refer to global
  variables.  Because I wanted the minimum syntax overhead to specify the
  context.  Because it's necessary to have the context for readability, but
  too much of it is just visual cruft.

  - `a` is the global holder of command line arguments.  All commands line
    arguments are in there, with default values for those that weren't actually
    on the command line.  It is of the class `Args`, and both are declared in
    `cli_arguments.py` and imported elsewhere.
  - `g` is the global holder of global variables.  It is of the class
    `Globals`, and both are declared in `globals.py` and imported elsewhere.

  And unfortunately importing a variable doesn't work the way I expected in
  Python.  I'm not sure exactly what happens, but I think a copy is made.
  Shallow copy probably.  Anyway, it hasn't impacted things so far but it's
  something to be aware of and I'll probably have to fix it if the script has
  further developments.
