"This was Mr. Bleaney's room. He stayed
The whole time he was at the Bodies, till
They moved him." Flowered curtains, thin and frayed,
Fall to within five inches of the sill.

Whose window shows a strip of building land,
Tussocky, littered. "Mr. Bleaney took
My bit of garden properly in hand." 
Bed, upright chair, sixty-watt bulb, no hook

Behind the door, no room for books or bags---
"I'll take it." So it happens that I lie
Where Mr. Bleaney lay, stub my fags 
On the same saucer-souvenir, and try

Stuffing my ears with cotton-wool, to drown
The jabbering set he egged her on to buy.
I know his habits---what time he came down,
His preference for sauce to gravy, why

He kept on plugging at the four aways---
Likewise their yearly frame: the Frinton folk
Who put him up for summer holidays,
And Christmas at his sister's house in Stoke.

But if he stood watching the frigid wind
Tousling the clouds, lay on the fusty bed
Telling himself that this was home, and grinned
And shivered, without shaking off the dread

That how we live measures our own nature,
And at his age having no more to show
Than one hired box should make him pretty sure
He warranted no better, I don't know.
