# Overview

_ValidationScenarios.jar_ is an executable JAR that can run one or more scenarios
against a **target network** using a **bootstrap** account to fund a `scenarioPayer`
that performs (most of) these operations.

All provided network nodes are targeted in a round-robin fashion.

The scenario names are `crypto`, `file`, `contract`, and `consensus`. Each
scenario can be limited to acting against **persistent** entities that were already
created by a previous execution; or the scenarios can be allowed to also create
and delete **novel** entites during execution.

If all scenarios are run with the `novel` flag, then at least one of every type
of HAPI operation is performed against the target network.

This looks like:

```
BOOTSTRAP_PASSPHRASE=secret \
  java -jar ValidationScenarios.jar \
    "target=mainnet" \
    "scenarios=file,contract" \
    "novel=true"
```

More example usages are given below.

## Target networks and bootstrap accounts

Target networks are defined via lists of nodes in the [_config.yml_](../devops-utils/validation-scenarios/config.yml)

Each target network must have a bootstrap account with a single key; the key must
be present in PEM format under the _keys/_ directory with the naming convention
_\{targetNetwork\}-account\{bootstrapNum\}.pem_. **IMPORTANT**: If the PEM passphrase
is not the string "swirlds", it must be set in the `BOOTSTRAP_PASSPHRASE` environment
variable.

As an example, take this mapping in _config.yml_:

```
networks:
  testnet:
    bootstrap: 50
    nodes:
    - {account: 3, ipv4Addr: 34.94.106.61}
    - {account: 4, ipv4Addr: 35.237.119.55}
    - {account: 5, ipv4Addr: 35.245.27.193}
    - {account: 6, ipv4Addr: 34.83.112.116}
```

It is necessary to save the key for account `0.0.50` in PEM format as
_keys/testnet-account50.pem_ file, and to export its passphrase to `BOOTSTRAP_PASSPHRASE`
in the environment used to execute the JAR.

## Persistent entities

The first time scenarios are run against a given target network,
various persistent entities are created, including a `scenarioPayer`
whose balance is topped up to be at least `ensureScenarioPayerHbars` at
the beginning of the execution.

The _config.yml_ is then overwritten with certain metadata for these persistent entities.
For example, since the JAR has already been executed against `testnet`, we have:

```
...
    scenarioPayer: 49542
    scenarios:
      consensus: {persistent: 39045}
      contract:
        persistent: {bytecode: 39042, luckyNo: 42, num: 39043, source: Multipurpose.sol}
      crypto: {receiver: 39038, sender: 39037}
      file:
        persistent: {contents: MrBleaney.txt, num: 39040}
```

**IMPORTANT:** If you delete any of this metadata from the _config.yml_, new
persistent entities will be recreated upon the next execution of the JAR. This
could be necessary if, for example, the key files controlling these entities
were accidentally deleted.

# Usage examples

## Checking the bootstrap account balance on mainnet

If no scenarios are given, then executing the JAR simply reports the bootstrap account balance.
For example, given the _config.yml_ in this directory, and an appropriate _keys/mainnet-account950.pem_
with passphrase exported in the `BOOTSTRAP_PASSPHRASE` environment variable,

```
$ java -jar ValidationScenarios.jar target=mainnet

```

## Rerunning a read-only file scenario against testnet

Given the _config.yml_ in this directory, the included _keys/testnet-account982.pem_, and
the included _files/MrBleaney.txt_, to validate the persistent file has the expected contents,

```
