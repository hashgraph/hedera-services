# Except for network-specific properties (e.g. testnet vs. mainnet), this file is intended to be an
# exact replica of file 121 on testnet and should match bootstrap.properties exactly.
# It will be used by modular code for all the property overrides.
# It does not have to match bootstrap.properties once that file is deprecated by the switch from mono-service to hedera-config.

#Overrides that differ based on the network
