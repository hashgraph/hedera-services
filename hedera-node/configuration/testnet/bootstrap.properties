# Except network-specific overrides (e.g. mainnet vs. testnet), this file is intended to
# be an exact replica of file 121 on testnet and should match application.properties exactly.
# Whenever a configuration change is made to file 121, it should be made here as well. There will be
# some lag time between the property change in file 121 and that same change promoted to the repo and
# to subsequent artifacts, but this span of time should be minimized as much as possible.
#
# This file will be used by mono-service for all the property overrides.
# This file will be deprecated when we deprecate using the mono-service config and fully move to hedera-config.
