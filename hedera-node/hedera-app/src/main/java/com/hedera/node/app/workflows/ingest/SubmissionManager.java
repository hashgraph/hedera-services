/**
 * The {@code SubmissionManager} submits transactions to the platform. As this is an honest node, it makes a strong
 * attempt to <strong>avoid</strong> submitting duplicate transactions to the platform.
 *
 * <p>An honest node does not want to submit duplicate transactions (since it will be charged for it). We use an
 * in-memory cache to keep track of transactions that have been submitted, sorted by transaction start time. This cache
 * is not part of state, because it will be different for different nodes.
 *
 * <p>Because this cache is not in state, if this node is restarted, it will forget about transactions it has already
 * submitted and could end up sending a <strong>single</strong> duplicate transaction per transaction. If there is a
 * poorly behaving client and this node reboots, it will no longer know the transaction is a duplicate and will submit
 * it, with the node ending up having to pay for it. If we had a shutdown hook we could save this information off during
 * graceful shutdown and reload it on startup, but we don't have that hook yet, and anyway hard crashes would still
 * impact the node.
 *
 * <p>In addition to tracking transaction IDs submitted <strong>by this node</strong>, the submitted transaction cache
 * will also contain entries for transactions submitted to other nodes, once this node sees those transactions in
 * pre-handle. If a user submits a transaction to 10 nodes, it is possible that none of the 10 nodes will recognize the
 * transaction as a duplicate and will submit all 10 to consensus, causing the user to pay for 1 full transaction and
 * 9 node+network fees. It is also possible that some of those nodes will learn by gossip about a transaction before
 * the user transaction hits the {@link SubmissionManager}, in which case those transactions will fail with
 * {@link com.hedera.hapi.node.base.ResponseCodeEnum#DUPLICATE_TRANSACTION} and the user will only pay for those
 * transactions which were not detected as duplicates during submission.
 *
 * <p>This cache is <strong>NOT</strong> impacted by falling behind or reconnecting, so the only time we will submit
 * duplicate transactions is if the node is restarted. We hope to improve this in the future.
