/**
 * {@link BlockRecordManager} is responsible for managing blocks and writing the block record stream. It manages:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Packaging transaction records into files and sending for writing</li>
 *     <li>Updating block number</li>
 *     <li>Computing running hashes</li>
 *     <li>Updating State for blocks and running hashes</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This API is used exclusively by {@link com.hedera.node.app.workflows.handle.HandleWorkflow}
 *
 * <p>This is {@link AutoCloseable} so it can wait for all inflight threads to finish and leave things in
 * a good state.
 *
 * <p>The {@link BlockRecordManager} operates on the principle that the consensus time on user transactions
 * <b>ALWAYS</b> increase with time. Transaction TX_2 will always have a higher consensus time than TX_1, and
 * TX_3 will be higher than TX_2, even if TX_2 were to fail, or be a duplicate. Likewise, we know for certain that
 * the entire set of user transaction, preceding transactions, and child transactions of TX_1 will have a consensus
 * time that comes before every preceding, user, and child transaction of TX_2.
 *
 * <p>This property allows us to make some assumptions that radically simplify the API and implementation.
 *
 * <p>While we currently produce block records on a fixed-second boundary (for example, every 2 seconds), it is possible
 * that some transactions have a consensus time that lies outside that boundary. This is OK, because it is not possible
 * to take the consensus time of a transaction and map back to which block it came from. Blocks use auto-incrementing
 * numbers, and if the network were idle for the duration of a block, there may be no block generated for that slice
 * of time. Thus, since you cannot map consensus time to block number, it doesn't matter if some preceding transactions
 * may have a consensus time that lies outside the "typical" block boundary.
