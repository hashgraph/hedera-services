/**
 * Represents the context of a single {@code preHandle()}-call.
 *
 * <p>During pre-handle, each transaction handler needs access to the transaction body data (i.e. the "operation"
 * being performed, colloquially also called the "transaction" and "transaction body" although both are more
 * or less technically incorrect). The actual {@link TransactionBody} can be accessed from this context. The body
 * contains the operation, the transaction ID, the originating node, and other information.
 *
 * <p>The main responsibility for a transaction handler during pre-handle is to semantically validate the operation
 * and to gather all required keys. The handler, when created, is preloaded with the correct payer key (which is
 * almost always the same as the transaction body's {@link TransactionID}, except in the case of a scheduled
 * transaction). {@link TransactionHandler}s must add any additional required signing keys. Several convenience
 * methods have been created for this purpose.
 *
 * <p>{@link #requireKey(Key)} is used to add a required non-payer signing key (remember, the payer signing
 * key was added when the context was created). Some basic validation is performed (the key cannot be null or empty).
