# Hedera API (HAPI) Protobuf

The _*.proto_ files in this repository define the services
offered by a node in the Hedera public network.

## Overview
There are five primary service families, which inter-operate on entities
controlled by one (or more) Ed25519 keypairs:
1. The [cryptocurrency service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/crypto_service.proto),
for cryptocurrency accounts with transfers denominated
in [hBar (ℏ)](https://help.hedera.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000674317-What-are-the-official-HBAR-cryptocurrency-denominations-).
2. The [consensus service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/consensus_service.proto), for
fast and unbiased ordering of opaque binary messages exchanged on
arbitrary topics.
3. The [smart contract service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/smart_contract_service.proto), for
execution of Solidity contract creations and calls; contract may both possess
ℏ themselves and exchange it with non-contract accounts.
4. The [file service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/file_service.proto), for storage and
retrieval of opaque binary data.
5. The [token service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/token_service.proto), for token related operations such as create, update, mint, burn, transfer etc..

There are also three secondary service families:
1. The [network service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/network_service.proto), for operations scoped
to the network or its constituent nodes rather user-controlled entities as above.
2. The [scheduling service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/schedule_service.proto), for scheduling a transaction to be executed when the ledger has received enough prequisite signatures.
3. The [freeze service](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-protobufs-java/blob/main/src/main/proto/freeze_service.proto), for use by
privileged accounts to suspend network operations during a maintenance window.

It is important to note that most network services are gated by fees which
must be paid **in ℏ from a cryptocurrency account**. The payer authorizes a
fee by signing an appropriate transaction with a sufficient subset of the
Ed25519/ECDSA(secp256k1) keys associated to their account.
