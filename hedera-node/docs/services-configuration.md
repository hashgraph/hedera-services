# Configuration properties

There are four kinds of property-based configuration used by
a Hedera Services network. These are,

1. **Bootstrap properties**, used only at the genesis of the network
   to create the initial system accounts and files. _Example_: the
   `bootstrap.hapiPermissions.path`, which points to the initial
   contents of the HAPI permissions system file.
2. **Static properties**, used throughout the network's lifetime;
   but change rarely or never, requiring a network restart to do so.
   _Example_: `accounts.systemAdmin`, the number of an account granted
   [various privileges](./privileged-transactions.md).
3. **Dynamic properties**, also used for consensus processing, and
   whose values can be changed during network operation by a `FileUpdate` to
   the file with number given by the static property
   `files.networkProperties`. _Example_: `tokens.maxPerAccount`, the
   limit on how many HTS tokens an account may be associated with.
4. **Node properties**, which have no affect on consensus processing,
   only customizing a given node's behavior. _Example_: `netty.prod.keepAliveTime`, the [keep-alive time](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/keepalive.md) for node's Netty server.

Note that property-based configuration does not include the network's
address book, fee schedules, exchange rates, HAPI permissions, or
throttle definitions.

# Property sources

The default values of all the network properties are in a
[_bootstrap.properties_ file](../hedera-node/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties)
that is deployed with the software in
a [JAR file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)).
However, it is possible to use external configuration to override
each kind of properties as described below.

## Overriding bootstrap and static properties

If a _data/config/bootstrap.properties_ file is present when the network
starts (including at genesis), then the contents of this file
override the defaults for any bootstrap or static property listed.
For example, when starting a network for integration testing, the
Services team often wants more permissive throttles than the
production defaults; and uses a _data/config/bootstrap.properties_ of,

```
bootstrap.throttleDefsJson.resource=throttles-dev.json
```

This causes the throttling definitions file `0.0.123` to be initialized
with a [genesis state](../hedera-node/src/main/resources/throttles-dev.json) that allows higher tps.

Of course, if a _data/config/bootstrap.properties_ is used, it **must**
be present on all nodes! Otherwise the state would be inconsistent
across the network. This makes the file less attractive for production
use cases.

## Overriding dynamic properties

The only way to override dynamic properties is via the contents
of the system file whose number is given by the static property
`files.networkProperties` (`0.0.121` by default).

However, the genesis contents of this file are initialized from
the properties file referenced by bootstrap property
`bootstrap.networkProperties.path`, which is
_data/config/application.properties_ by default. When running
locally, Services developers generally override
`balances.exportDir.path`, which has a production default of
_/opt/hgcapp/accountBalances_.

Please do keep in mind that setting _data/config/application.properties_
has **no impact after network genesis**! Once the network is
initialized, the only way to override a dynmic property is by
a `FileUpdate` to file `0.0.121` with a payload of type
[`ServicesConfigurationList`](https://hashgraph.github.io/hedera-protobufs/#proto.ServicesConfigurationList).

## Overriding node properties

If a _data/config/node.properties_ file is present whenever a node
starts, then this file's contents override the defaults. For example,
when testing locally with multiple logical nodes in the same JVM, it
is often useful to set the `hedera.profiles.active` node property
to `DEV`, which by default causes only the node with account `0.0.3`
to bind its gRPC server.
