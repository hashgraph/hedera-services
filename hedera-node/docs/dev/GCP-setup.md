# **Personal JSON set up for regression**

As defined in the example below, set up your personal JSON with the following details.
1. `name` should be GCP-Personal-<USER_NAME>.

# **Creating instances manually**

JRS provisions instances for the regression tests. If in any case, we need to create instances manually follow the steps below.
1. Go to `console.cloud.google.com`. From the main menu `Google Cloud Platform` go to `Compute Engine -> Instance Groups`.
2. Click `Create instance group` at the top.
3. Select the following options:
- Name: `<username>-<branchname>-<year><month><day><militarytime>`.
- Select Single Zone.
- Region: select the region eg: us-east1.
- Instance template:  select the highest numbered `atf-node-instance-template`.
- Currently `atf-node-instance-template-9-256hd` is used for servers.
- Currently `atf-node-instance-template-9-10hd-4cpu-8mem` is used for clients.
- Autoscaling mode: select `Don’t autoscale`.
- Number of Instances: Depending on the instance group being created for servers or clients, select the number of instances to be provisioned. This option can’t be set until autoscale is turned off.
- Provide number of server nodes + zero stake nodes for server instance group.
- Provide number of test clients for client instance group.

4. Click on Create.
5. Click on `VM Instances` on left-hand menu to see individual instances and get IP addresses.

**NOTE:** Two separate instance groups should be created for servers and clients for services regression.

**NOTE:** Individual instances inside an instance group can't be deleted. You must delete the group from `Instance Groups` page.

# **Deleting instances manually**

JRS shuts down the instances provisioned at the end of test. Sometimes if the user kills the test run in the middle or if the controlling machine loses connection, google cloud instances are not shut down. In this scenario delete the instances manually by following the steps below.

1. From the main menu in `Google Cloud Platform` go to ` Compute Engine -> Instance Groups`.
2. Select the groups with your name that should not be running.
3. Click `Delete` on the top menu.
