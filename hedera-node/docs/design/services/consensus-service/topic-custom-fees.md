# Topic custom fees

## Purpose

The implementation of a native fixed fee system for the submission of topic messages on the Hedera network, will add the possibility of adding custom fees to a given topic.

## Prerequisite reading

* [HIP-991](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-991)

## Goals

1. Update existing `ConsensusCreateTopic`, `ConsensusUpdateTopic` and `ConsensusTopicInfo` to support custom fees.
2. Update existing `ConsensusSubmitMessage` to validate and charge custom fees, if needed.

## Architecture

### HAPI Updates

Topics now have a new Fee Schedule Key.

```protobuf
/**
 * Access control for update/delete of custom fees.
 * <p>
 * If unset, custom fees CANNOT be set for this topic.<br/>
 * If not set when the topic is created, this field CANNOT be set via update.
 * If set when the topic is created, this field MAY be changed via update.
 */
Key fee_schedule_key = 8;
```

Topics can have an optional fees for submitting messages.

```protobuf
/**
 * A set of custom fee definitions.<br/>
 * These are fees to be assessed for each submit to this topic.
 * <p>
 * Each fee defined in this set SHALL be evaluated for
 * each message submitted to this topic, and the resultant
 * total assessed fees SHALL be charged.<br/>
 * Custom fees defined here SHALL be in addition to the base
 * network and node fees.
 */
repeated ConsensusCustomFee custom_fees = 10;
```

Fees can be set in HBAR or HTS fungible tokens.

```protobuf
/**
 * A custom fee definition for a consensus topic.
 *
 * This fee definition is specific to an Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) topic
 * and SHOULD NOT be used in any other context.<br/>
 * All fields for this message are REQUIRED.<br/>
 * Only "fixed" fee definitions are supported because there is no basis for
 * a fractional fee on a consensus submit transaction.
 */
message ConsensusCustomFee {
  /**
   * A fixed custom fee.
   * <p>
   * The amount of HBAR or other token described by this `FixedFee` SHALL
   * be charged to the transction payer for each message submitted to a
   * topic that assigns this consensus custom fee.
   */
  FixedFee fixed_fee = 1;

  /**
   * A collection account identifier.
   * <p>
   * All amounts collected for this consensus custom fee SHALL be transferred
   * to the account identified by this field.
   */
  AccountID fee_collector_account_id = 2;
}
```

Topics can have a list of keys that are allowed to send free messages.

```protobuf
/**
 * A set of keys that are allowed to submit messages to the topic without
 * paying the topic's custom fees.
 * <p>
 * If a submit transaction is signed by _any_ key included in this set,
 *  custom fees SHALL NOT be charged for that transaction.
 * <p>
 * If fee_exempt_key_list is unset in this transaction, there SHALL NOT be
 * any fee-exempt keys.  In particular, the following keys SHALL NOT be
 * implicitly or automatically added to this list:
 * `adminKey`, `submitKey`, `fee_schedule_key`.
 */
repeated Key fee_exempt_key_list = 9;
```

Note:
In `consensus_update_topic`, `custom_fees` and `fee_exempt_key_list` are wrapped in order to differentiate between setting an empty list and not updating the list.

The `ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionBody` message is updated to include the optional max_custom_fees property for specifying the maximum fee that the user is willing to pay for the message.

```protobuf
message ConsensusSubmitMessageTransactionBody {
  [..]
  /**
    * The maximum custom fee that the user is willing to pay for the message. This field will be ignored if `accept_all_custom_fees` is set to `true`.
    */
  repeated FixedFee max_custom_fees = 4;

  /**
   * If set to true, the transaction will accept all custom fees from the topic id
   */
  bool accept_all_custom_fees = 5;
}
```

### Fees

- Topics may have fees for submitting messages.
- Fees are defined as a list of custom fees.
- The list of custom fees can contain a maximum of `MAX_CUSTOM_FEE_ENTRIES_FOR_TOPICS` entries.
- A custom fee is defined leveraging the HTSâ€™s FixedFee data structure.
- A custom fee can be set in HBAR or HTS fungible tokens and must have an accountID as collector.
- Fees can be set at topic creation time.
- Fees can be changed (updated or removed) in a topic with an update topic transaction signed by the Fee Schedule Key.

### Keys

- Topics can have a Fee Schedule Key set at creation time.
- The Fee Schedule Key can manage fee updates for the topic.
- Only the Admin Key should be able to remove the Fee Schedule Key.
- The Fee Schedule Key can change itself to another valid or unusable key.
- If the topic was created without a Fee Schedule Key, the key cannot be added later.

### Service updates

#### ConsensusTopicInfo

- Update in `topic.proto` the `Topic` protobuf message, to be able to store the new fields in the state.

```protobuf
    /**
     * Access control for update/delete of custom fees.
     * <p>
     * If this field is unset, the current custom fees CANNOT be changed.<br/>
     * If this field is set, that `Key` MUST sign any transaction to update
     * the custom fee schedule for this topic.
     */
    Key fee_schedule_key = 11;

    /**
     * A list of "privileged payer" keys.
     * <p>
     * If a submit transaction is signed by _any_ key from this list,
     * custom fees SHALL NOT be charged for that transaction.<br/>
     * If fee_exempt_key_list is unset, it SHALL _implicitly_ contain
     * the key `admin_key`, the key `submit_key`, and the key
     * `fee_schedule_key`, if any of those keys are set.
     */
    repeated Key fee_exempt_key_list = 12;

    /**
     * A set of custom fee definitions.<br/>
     * These are fees to be assessed for each submit to this topic.
     * <p>
     * If this list is empty, the only fees charged for a submit to this
     * topic SHALL be the network and node fees.<br/>
     * If this list is not empty, each fee defined in this set SHALL
     * be evaluated for each message submitted to this topic, and the
     * resultant total assessed fees SHALL be charged.<br/>
     * If this list is not empty, custom fees defined here SHALL be
     * charged _in addition to_ the base network and node fees.
     */
    repeated ConsensusCustomFee custom_fees = 13;
```
