# Service Configuration

The bulleted list below provides a comprehensive overview of the various configuration settings used in the Hedera Services. These settings are defined in various Config classes, 
each managing a specific aspect of the system. For instance, 
`AccountsConfig.java` controls account-related properties, while 
`ContractsConfig.java` manages smart contract settings. 
This document serves as a valuable resource for understanding how 
Hedera Services can be customized and configured to meet specific requirements.
