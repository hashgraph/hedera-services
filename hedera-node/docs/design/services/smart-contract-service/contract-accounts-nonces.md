# Contract Accounts Nonces Externalization

## Purpose

In order to provide more complete EVM account equivalence support and a better developer experience for [eth_getTransactionCount](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#eth_gettransactioncount) we must externalize the contract account nonce value changes from Consenus Node to Mirror Node.

## Goals

- Fix logic for storing of contract nonces in Consensus Node state
- Externalize contract accounts nonces in transaction records

## Non Goals

- Handle nonce updates for EOAs

## Assumptions

- Mirror Node is able to process nonce updates through transaction records

## Architecture

The following is a table with general use cases and behavior for Ethereum and Hedera:

### Contract Nonce Externalization

- We keep a `ContractId -> nonce` tree map inside [HederaWorldState](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/store/contracts/HederaWorldState.java#L79), it is updated on each call of `commit()` (using newly added method `trackContractNonces()`).
- Method `trackContractNonces` in [HederaWorldState](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/store/contracts/HederaWorldState.java#L393) follows the pattern of `trackNewlyCreatedAccounts`.
  - Checks if an account is a new smart contract and externalizes its nonce.
  - Checks if an existing smart contract's nonce is updated and externalizes it.
- Added a `ContractId -> nonce` tree map inside [TransactionProcessingResult](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/contracts/execution/TransactionProcessingResult.java#L45).
- Persists account contract nonces into state in [ContractCreateTransitionLogic](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/txns/contract/ContractCreateTransitionLogic.java#L209) and [ContractCallTransitionLogic](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/txns/contract/ContractCallTransitionLogic.java#L148) using `setContractNonces` from `TransactionProcessingResult`.
- Created new [ContractNonceInfo](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/main/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/state/submerkle/ContractNonceInfo.java) submerkle class with two main entities - `contractId` and `nonce`
- Added new method `serializableContractNoncesFrom` in [EvmFnResult](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/state/submerkle/EvmFnResult.java) that builds `List<ContractNonceInfo>` (submerkle) from `Map<ContractID, Long>`
- Added new verison `7` (`RELEASE_0400_VERSION`) and externalized logic for `serialize` and `deserialize` of `contractNonces` in `EvmFnResult`

### Fix Storing Of Nonces Into State

- Currently we are not storing contract account nonces into state and this needs a fix similar to `setBalance` in [UpdateTrackingAccount](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-evm/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/evm/store/models/UpdateTrackingAccount.java).
- For all created and updated contracts we should store their nonces in state.
  - We need a way to track a contract account's `nonce` by its `address`.
  - - Added method `setNonce` in [UpdateAccountTracker](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-evm/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/evm/store/UpdateAccountTracker.java)
  - - Added method `setNonce` in [UpdateAccountTrackerImpl](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/store/UpdateAccountTrackerImpl.java)
  - - It sets property `ETHEREUM_NONCE` for `address` into `trackingAccounts`
  - Updated `setNonce` in [UpdateTrackingAccount](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-evm/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/evm/store/models/UpdateTrackingAccount.java#L142) to use [UpdateAccountTrackerImpl](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/store/UpdateAccountTrackerImpl.java#L51)'s implementation
  - `AbstractLedgerWorldUpdater` -> `createAccount` -> `newMutable.setNonce(nonce)`
  - `AbstractStackedLedgerUpdater` -> `commit` -> `mutable.setNonce(updatedAccount.getNonce())`
- We also need a way to read a contract account's nonces from state.
  - Added `getNonce` method in [HederaEvmEntityAccess](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-evm/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/evm/store/contracts/HederaEvmEntityAccess.java#L29)
  - Added `getNonce` method in [HederaLedger](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/ledger/HederaLedger.java#L230) that retrieves `nonce` by `AccountID`
  - Added `getNonce` method in [MutableEntityAccess](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-mono-service/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/mono/store/contracts/MutableEntityAccess.java#L103) that uses `HederaLedger`'s `getNonce`
  - Updated `getNonce` in [WorldStateAccount](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/96a85f0e08f82582bbf25328d14ca90fc630c5ef/hedera-node/hedera-evm/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/evm/store/contracts/WorldStateAccount.java#L61) to return value from state using `entityAccess` instead of `0`

### Calculate and use proper EVM addresses for `CREATE` addresses instead of using Hedera specific long-zero addresses

After we start storing accurate contract nonce values in state we will be able to calculate `CREATE` addresses for new contracts as per the Ethereum yellow paper.
We will need to update `HederaEvmCreateOperation.targetContractAddress` to calculate the `CREATE` address of a new contract based on the sender's address and nonce.

### Feature Flags

We will need to add two feature flags:
- one for toggling the contract nonce externalization in transaction handling e.g. `contracts.nonces.externalization.enabled`

### Merging of contract into hollow account

When a contract is created, and it does not create other contracts in its constructor, its nonce is set to 1 (as specified in [EIP-161](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-161.md)).
In general if the contract creates `N` other contracts in its constructor, then its nonce should be equal to `1+N`.
When contract is merged into an existing hollow account, we should update implementation in `HederaCreateOperationExternalizer.finalizeHollowAccountIntoContract`, to correctly set its nonce value to `1+N` as described in the general case above.

### New Classes

- `ContractNonceInfo` in submerkle

## Acceptance Tests

### Positive Tests

* Verify that when contract A successfully deploys contract B, the nonce of contract A is incremented by 1 and the nonce of contract B is set to 1.
* Verify that when contact A with nonce 2 calls contract B with nonce 1 that creates contract C and contract D, the nonce of contract A is still 2 and the resulting `ContractFunctionResult` has the following nonce values:
  * B -> 3
  * C -> 1
  * D -> 1
* Verify that when contract A is merged into hollow account H, the nonce of the resulting account is set to 1.
* Verify that when contract A is merged into hollow account H and the init code of A also deploys contract B, the nonce of the resulting account is 2 and the nonce of contract B is set to 1.
* Verify that when feature flag is disabled contract nonces won't be externalized.

### Negative Tests

* Verify that when contract A fails to deploy contract B, the nonce of contract A is still incremented by 1.
