# AddressBookTestingTool Instructions

This document describes various manual tests that were performed using this testing app. This
playbook should be used when designing automated tests using this app.

## Global Modifications and Starting Conditions

Be sure to clean and assemble the whole project if the java files have been modified.

### config.txt

comment out the current app

```
# app,		StatsDemo.jar,		   1, 3000, 0, 100, -1, 200
```

uncomment the AddressBookTestingTool.jar

```
app,    AddressBookTestingTool.jar,
```

### settings.txt

Add the following lines to the settings.txt file

```
addressBookTestingTool.softwareVersion, 1
addressBookTestingTool.weightingBehavior, 1
```

## Testing Genesis Behavior

### Test Scenario 1: Force Use of Config Address Book on Genesis

#### Instructions

1. Delete `sdk/data/saved` directory if it exists
2. Ensure settings.txt has the following values
