# ISSTestingTool Instructions

This document describes various manual tests that were performed using this testing app. This
playbook should be used when designing automated tests using this app.

## Global Modifications and Starting Conditions

Be sure to clean and assemble the whole project if the java files have been modified.

### config.txt

comment out the current app

```
# app,		StatsDemo.jar,		   1, 3000, 0, 100, -1, 200
```

uncomment the ISSTestingTool.jar

```
app,    ISSTestingTool.jar,
```

### settings.txt

Add the following lines to the settings.txt file. Here are some example settings that can be used to test the app.

```
issTestingTool.transactionsPerSecond,     100
issTestingTool.plannedISSs,               1234:0-1+2+3
issTestingTool.plannedLogErrors,          100:1-2-3
```

- `transactionsPerSecond` is a property configuring how many transactions per second the TransactionGenerator should perform
- `plannedISSs` is a property configuring the planned ISSs. Describes a list of intentional ISS that will take place at a given time on a given set of nodes.

  Let's take the value above as an example - `1234:0-1+2+3`.

  The first number is a time, in seconds, after genesis, when the ISS will be triggered. Here the ISS will be triggered 1234 seconds after genesis (measured by consensus time).
  The time MUST be followed by a `:`.
  Next is a `-` separated list of ISS partitions. Each ISS partition will agree with other nodes in the same partition, and disagree with any node not in the partition. In this example, node 0 is in an ISS partition by
  itself, and nodes 1 2 and 3 are in a partition together. Nodes in the same partition should be separated by a `+` symbol.

  A few more examples:
  - `60:0-1-2-3`: 60 seconds after the app is started, all nodes disagree with all other nodes
  - `600:0+1-2+3`: 10 minutes after start, the network splits in half. 0 and 1 agree, 2 and 3 agree.
  - `120:0+1-2+3-4+5+6`: a seven node network. The ISS is triggered 120 seconds after start. Nodes 0 and 1 agree with each other, nodes 2 and 3 agree with each other, and nodes 4 5 and 6 agree with each other.

- `plannedLogErrors` (currently not utilized) is a property configuring the planned log errors. Describes a list of intentional log errors that will take place at a given time on a given set of nodes.

  Let's take the value above as an example - `100:1-2-3`.

  Where the first number is the number of seconds after genesis that the error should be logged at, and the list of numbers following the `:` are the node IDs of the nodes that the error should be logged on.

## Testing ISS behavior

### Testing ISS without having super majority

#### Instructions

1. Delete `sdk/data/saved` directory if it exists
2. Ensure settings.txt has the following  example values

```
issTestingTool.transactionsPerSecond,     100
issTestingTool.plannedISSs,               20:0+1-2+3
issTestingTool.plannedLogErrors,          30:0
```

3. Run the app for at least the time set for provoking the ISS. In this case, 20 seconds.

#### Validation

Check `swirlds.log` and ensure there are no unexpected exceptions or errors.

Validate that the ISSTestingTool has been started by checking the following message:

        -INFO  STARTUP <main> ISSTestingToolMain: ISSTestingToolState is registered with ConstructableRegistry

Check that the planned ISSs has been provoked by checking for a log message like this:

        -INFO  STARTUP <<scheduler TransactionHandler>> ISSTestingToolState: ISS intentionally provoked. This ISS was planned to occur at time after genesis PT20S, and actually occurred at time after genesis PT20.259604S in round 63. This node (2) is in partition 1 and will agree with the hashes of all other nodes in partition 1. Nodes in other partitions are expected to have divergent hashes.

Validate that the platform system itself detects the ISS by getting a log message like this:

        -FATAL EXCEPTION <platformForkJoinThread-3> DefaultIssDetector: Catastrophic Invalid State Signature (ISS)
        Due to divergence in state hash between many network members, this network is incapable of continued operation without human intervention.

As a final there should be a final log message noting that the PLATFORM_STATUS changes to `CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE`

        -INFO  PLATFORM_STATUS  <platformForkJoinThread-2> DefaultStatusStateMachine: Platform spent 19.9 s in ACTIVE. Now in CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE {"oldStatus":"ACTIVE","newStatus":"CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE"} [com.swirlds.logging.legacy.payload.PlatformStatusPayload]

### Testing ISS with having super majority

#### Instructions

1. Delete `sdk/data/saved` directory if it exists
2. Ensure settings.txt has the following  example values

```
issTestingTool.transactionsPerSecond,     200
issTestingTool.plannedISSs,               20:0+1+2+3+4+5:6+7+8
issTestingTool.plannedLogErrors,          30:0
```

3. Run the app for at least the time set for provoking the ISS. In this case, 20 seconds.

#### Validation

Check `swirlds.log` and ensure there are no unexpected exceptions or errors.

Validate that the ISSTestingTool has been started by checking the following message:

        -INFO  STARTUP <main> ISSTestingToolMain: ISSTestingToolState is registered with ConstructableRegistry

Check that the planned ISSs has been provoked by checking for a log message like this:

        -INFO  STARTUP <<scheduler TransactionHandler>> ISSTestingToolState: ISS intentionally provoked. This ISS was planned to occur at time after genesis PT20S, and actually occurred at time after genesis PT20.050205S in round 24. This node (6) is in partition -1 and will agree with the hashes of all other nodes in partition -1. Nodes in other partitions are expected to have divergent hashes.

Validate that the platform system itself detects the ISS by getting a log message like this:

        -FATAL EXCEPTION <platformForkJoinThread-8> DefaultIssDetector: Invalid State Signature (ISS): this node has the wrong hash for round 25.

As a final there should be a final log message noting that the PLATFORM_STATUS changes to `CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE` but then switch to `CHECKING`

        -INFO  PLATFORM_STATUS  <platformForkJoinThread-7> DefaultStatusStateMachine: Platform spent 21.2 s in ACTIVE. Now in CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE {"oldStatus":"ACTIVE","newStatus":"CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE"} [com.swirlds.logging.legacy.payload.PlatformStatusPayload]
        -INFO  PLATFORM_STATUS  <platformForkJoinThread-2> DefaultStatusStateMachine: Platform spent 30.3 s in ACTIVE. Now in CHECKING {"oldStatus":"ACTIVE","newStatus":"CHECKING"} [com.swirlds.logging.legacy.payload.PlatformStatusPayload]
