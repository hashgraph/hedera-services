/**
 * An array-backed concurrent data structure optimized for use by the {@link VirtualNodeCache}.
 * <p>
 * This class has been carefully designed to enable a high rate of concurrency (mostly lock-free)
 * with a minimum of array copying overhead. We were not able to avoid all array copies (see the
 * implementation of {@link #stream()}. If we could have found a better way to do
 * concurrent sorting without needing to rewrite a pile of highly optimized sort code from the JDK
 * or an array copy, we would have done it). This class has been very careful to be defensive and
 * assert which operations are safe to execute concurrently on mutable instances and which require
 * immutable instances. Please see the documentation for each field and method to get a deeper
 * understanding of those conditions.
 * <p>
 * A {@link ConcurrentArray} is created with a {@code capacity}. The capacity is used to size the
 * underlying arrays and to indicate the growth rate. When the underlying storage must be expanded,
 * this class does not double the size of the storage, it simply increments by {@code capacity}.
 * <p>
 * Typically, an instance is created and then {@link #add(Object)} is called repeatedly. When the
 * {@link VirtualNodeCache} wishes to merge two arrays together, it will call {@link #merge(ConcurrentArray)}.
 * Both arrays for this operation <strong>must</strong> be immutable. An array is made immutable
 * by calling {@link #seal()}.
 * <p>
 * After all elements have been added, the {@link #stream()} method can be called to get
 * a sorted stream of all array elements. Since this operation is incompatible with concurrent calls to
 * {@link #add(Object)}, the instance must first be sealed {@link #seal()} before calling {@code sortedStream}.
 * This is a safety precaution to guard against accidental sorting of a mutable {@link ConcurrentArray}.
 *

     * As elements are added, they eventually fill up the sub-array, and it becomes necessary to create
     * a new sub-array and add it to the list.
     * <p>
     * A naive implementation of this class may have attempted to use a single array and, using synchronization,
     * resize the array. Indeed, this would be relatively easy to code. However, we found a few issues with this.
     * First, it required a rather coarse-grained lock which was bad for performance. Second, it required large
     * array copies, which hurt performance.
     * <p>
     * Instead, we have a linked list of smaller "sub" arrays. Whenever we need to grow capacity,
     * rather than creating a new larger array and copying all the elements out of the old array into the new one,
     * we simply create a new array. Whenever we need to "merge" another {@link ConcurrentArray} with this
     * one, we just link them together and avoid all array copies.
     * <p>
     * To make this safe, it is imperative that <strong>only</strong> an immutable {@link ConcurrentArray} is the
     * source of a copy, so that the destination array can safely refer to the sub-arrays of the source.
