/**
 * Defines a data source, used with {@code VirtualMap}, to implement a virtual tree. Both in-memory and

 * implementation.

 * The {@link VirtualDataSource} defines methods for getting the root node, and for looking up a leaf node
 * by key.
 * <p>
 * The nodes returned by the methods on this interface represent the *LATEST* state on disk. Once retrieved,
 * the nodes can be fast-copied for later versions, and persisted to disk via *archive*.
