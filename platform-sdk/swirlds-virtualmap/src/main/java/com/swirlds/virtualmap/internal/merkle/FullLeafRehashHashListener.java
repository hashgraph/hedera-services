/**
 * A {@link VirtualHashListener} implementation used by {@link VirtualRootNode} on start if rehashing is required.
 * On start, all the leaves will be rehashed in ascending order if hashes for them were not previously calculated.
 * The hashing algorithm in the {@link com.swirlds.virtualmap.internal.hash.VirtualHasher} is setup to hash
 * enormous trees in breadth-first order.
 * As the hasher hashes, it notifies this listener which then stores up the changes into different sorted lists.
 * Then, when the "batch" is completed, it flushes the data in the proper order to the data source. This process
 * completely bypasses the {@link com.swirlds.virtualmap.internal.cache.VirtualNodeCache} and the
 * {@link com.swirlds.virtualmap.internal.pipeline.VirtualPipeline}, which is essential for performance and memory
 * reasons, since during reconnect we may need to process the entire data set, which is too large to fit in memory.
 * <p>
 * Three things are required for this listener to work: the {@code firstLeafPath}, the {@code lastLeafPath}, and
 * the {@link VirtualDataSource}.
 * <p>
 * A tree is broken up into "ranks" where "rank 0" is the on that contains root, "rank 1" is the one that contains
 * the left and right children of root, "rank 2" has the children of the nodes in "rank 1", and so forth. The higher
 * the rank, the deeper in the tree the rank lives.
 * <p>
 * A "batch" is a portion of the tree that is independently hashed. The batch will always be processed from the
 * deepest rank (the leaves) to the lowest rank (nearest the top). When we flush, we flush in the opposite order
 * from the closest to the top of the tree to the deepest rank. Each rank is processed in ascending path order.
 * So we store each rank as a separate array and then stream them out in the proper order to disk.
 *
