/**
 * A cache for virtual merkel trees.
 * <p>
 * At genesis, a virtual merkel tree has an empty {@link VirtualNodeCache} and no data on disk. As values
 * are added to the tree, corresponding {@link VirtualLeafRecord}s are added to the cache. When the round
 * completes, a fast-copy of the tree is made, along with a fast-copy of the cache. Any new changes to the
 * modifiable tree are done through the corresponding copy of the cache. The original tree and original
 * cache have <strong>IMMUTABLE</strong> leaf data. The original tree is then submitted to multiple hashing
 * threads. For each internal node that is hashed, a {@link VirtualHashRecord} is created and added
 * to the {@link VirtualNodeCache}.
 * <p>
 * Eventually, there are multiple copies of the cache in memory. It may become necessary to merge two
 * caches together. The {@link #merge()} method is provided to merge a cache with the one-prior cache.
 * These merges are non-destructive, meaning it is OK to continue to query against a cache that has been merged.
 * <p>
 * At some point, the cache should be flushed to disk. This is done by calling the {@link #dirtyLeavesForFlush(long,
 * long)} and {@link #dirtyHashesForFlush(long)} methods and sending them to the code responsible for flushing. The
 * cache itself knows nothing about the data source or how to save data, it simply maintains a record of mutations
 * so that some other code can perform the flushing.
 * <p>
 * A cache is {@link FastCopyable}, so that each copy of the {@link VirtualMap} has a corresponding copy of the
 * {@link VirtualNodeCache}, at the same version. It keeps track of immutability of leaf data and internal
 * data separately, since the set of dirty leaves in a copy is added during {@code handleTransaction}
 * (which uses the most current copy), but the set of dirty internals during the {@code hashing} phase,
 * which is always one-copy removed from the current copy.
 * <p>
 * Caches have pointers to the next and previous caches in the chain of copies. This is necessary to support
 * merging of two caches (we could have added API to explicitly merge two caches together, but our use case
 * only supports merging a cache and its next-of-kin (the next copy in the chain), so we made this the only
 * supported case in the API).
 * <p>
 * The {@link VirtualNodeCache} was designed with our specific performance requirements in mind. We need to
 * maintain a chain of mutations over versions (the so-called map-of-lists approach to a fast-copy data
 * structure), yet we need to be able to get all mutations for a given version quickly, and we need to release
 * memory back to the garbage collector quickly. We also need to maintain the mutations for leaf data, for
 * which leaves occupied a given path, and for the internal node hashes at a given path.
 * <p>
 * To fulfill these design requirements, each "chain" of caches share three different indexes:
 * {@link #keyToDirtyLeafIndex}, {@link #pathToDirtyLeafIndex}, and {@link #pathToDirtyHashIndex}.
 * Each of these is a map from either the leaf key or a path (long) to a custom linked list data structure. Each element
 * in the list is a {@link Mutation} with a reference to the data item (either a {@link VirtualHashRecord}
 * or a {@link VirtualLeafRecord}, depending on the list), and a reference to the next {@link Mutation}
 * in the list. In this way, given a leaf key or path (based on the index), you can get the linked list and
 * walk the links from mutation to mutation. The most recent mutation is first in the list, the oldest mutation
 * is last. There is at most one mutation per cache per entry in one of these indexes. If a leaf value is modified
 * twice in a single cache, only a single mutation exists recording the most recent change. There is no need to
 * keep track of multiple mutations per cache instance for the same leaf or internal node.
 * <p>
 * If there is one non-obvious gotcha that you *MUST* be aware of to use this class, it is that a record
 * (leaf or internal) *MUST NOT BE REUSED ACROSS CACHE INSTANCES*. If I create a leaf record, and put it
 * into {@code cache0}, and then create a copy of {@code cache0} called {@code cache1}, I *MUST NOT* put
 * the same leaf record into {@code cache1} or modify the old leaf record, otherwise I will pollute
 * {@code cache0} with a leaf modified outside of the lifecycle for that cache. Instead, I must make a
 * fast copy of the leaf record and put *that* copy into {@code cache1}.
 *

 * 		The type of key used for leaves
 * @param <V>
