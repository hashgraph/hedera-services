 * virtual tree rank by rank, top to bottom. Every node is checked to have a clean parent on
 * its path to the root. If a clean parent is found, the node is skipped (not sent to the teacher).
 *
 * <p>Clean nodes are tracked in a concurrent set. This set is populated in {@link
 * #nodeReceived(long, boolean)} on the receiving thread. Since teacher responses are always
 * lagging behind learner requests, some clean nodes may be requested redundantly. That is,
 * a request for a clean node is sent before a response for any of its clean parents is
