/**
 * Virtual node traversal policy to traverse the virtual tree bottom-up. It contains two phases,
 * the first includes internal nodes, the second is for leaves.
 *
 * <p>The first phase. At the leaf parent rank (the rank of the first leaf path, minus 1) all
 * internal nodes are split into chunks. Every chunk has a start rank (leaf parent rank, or
 * first leaf rank for the part of the tree on top of the last rank leaves) and width (number
 * of internal nodes in the chunk at its rank). For every chunk, its starting path is sent first,
 * this is the first path at chunk's rank.
 *
 * <p>When a response for an internal node is received from the teacher: if the node is clean,
 * and it's the left child, a request for its parent node is sent. If the parent is clean and
 * left, a request is sent for the grand parent, and so on. If the node is dirty, the next
 * request for this chunk is sent at its starting rank again, skipping all nodes in clear
 * sub-trees.
 *
 * <p>Since responses are received independently of requests, it may happen that a request
 * for every chunk are sent, but no responses are there yet. In this case, this class makes a
 * pessimistic assumption that the previously sent path is dirty, and proceeds to the next
 * path at chunk's starting rank. It may result in redundant nodes sent (a clean node is sent
 * before a response for one of its clean parents is received), but it increases overall
 * throughput.
 *
 * <p>The second phase starts when requests for all internal nodes in all chunks have been
 * sent (but responses may not have been recorded). At this phase, all leaves are traversed
 * from the first leaf path to the last leaf path, skipping paths with clean parents. At
 * this step some clean leaves may be sent redundantly, too.
