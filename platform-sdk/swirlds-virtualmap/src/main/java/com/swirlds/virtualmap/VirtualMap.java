/**
 * A {@link MerkleInternal} node that virtualizes all of its children, such that the child nodes
 * may not exist in RAM until they are required. Significantly, <strong>downward traversal in
 * the tree WILL NOT always returns consistent results until after hashes have been computed.</strong>
 * During the hash phase, all affected internal nodes are discovered and updated and "realized" into
 * memory. From that point, downward traversal through the tree will produce consistent results.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <p><strong>Virtualization</strong></p>
 *
 * <p>
 * All node data is persisted in a {@link VirtualDataSource}. The typical implementation would store node
 * data on disk. While an in-memory implementation may exist for various reasons (testing, benchmarking,
 * performance optimizations for certain scenarios), the best way to reason about this class is to
 * assume that the data source implementation is based on storing data on a filesystem.
 * <p>
 * Initially, the root node and other nodes are on disk and not in memory. When a client of the API
 * uses any of the map-like APIs, a leaf is read into memory. To make this more efficient, the leaf's
 * data is loaded lazily. Accessing the value causes the value to be read and deserialized from disk,
 * but does not cause the hash to be read or deserialized from disk. Central to the implementation is
 * avoiding as much disk access and deserialization as possible.
 * <p>
 * Each time a leaf is accessed, either for modification or reading, we first check an in-memory cache
 * to see if this leaf has already been accessed in some way. If so, we get it from memory directly and
 * avoid hitting the disk. The cache is shared across all copies of the map, so we actually check memory
 * for any existing versions going back to the oldest version that is still in memory (typically, a dozen
 * or so). If we have a cache miss there, then we go to disk, read an object, and place it in the cache,
 * if it will be modified later or is being modified now. We do not cache into memory records that are
 * only read. See {@link #getForModify(VirtualKey)}.
 * <p>
 * One important optimization is avoiding accessing internal nodes during transaction handling. If a leaf
 * is added, we will need to create a new internal node, but we do not need to "walk up the tree" making
 * copies of the existing nodes. When we delete a leaf, we need to delete an internal node, but we don't
 * need to do anything special in that case either (except to delete it from our in memory cache). Avoiding
 * this work is important for performance, but it does lead to inconsistencies when traversing the children
 * of this node using an iterator, or any of the getChild methods on the class. This is because the state
 * of those internal nodes is unknown until we put in the work to sort them out. We do this efficiently during
 * the hashing process. Once hashing is complete, breadth or depth first traversal of the tree will be
 * correct and consistent for that version of the tree. It isn't hashing itself that makes the difference,
 * it is the method by which iteration happens.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <p><strong>Lifecycle</strong></p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link VirtualMap} is created at startup and copies are made as rounds are processed. Each map becomes
 * immutable through its map-like API after it is copied. Internal nodes can still be hashed until the hashing
 * round completes. Eventually, a map must be retired, and all in-memory references to the internal and leaf
 * nodes released for garbage collection, and all the data written to disk. It is <strong>essential</strong>
 * that data is written to disk in order from oldest to newest copy. Although maps may be released in any order,
 * they <strong>MUST</strong> be written to disk strictly in-order and only the oldest copy in memory can be
 * written. There cannot be an older copy in memory with a newer copy being written to disk.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <p><strong>Map-like Behavior</strong></p>
 * <p>
 * This class presents a map-like interface for getting and putting values. These values are stored
 * in the leaf nodes of this node's sub-tree. The map-like methods {@link #get(VirtualKey)},
 * {@link #put(VirtualKey, VirtualValue)}, {@link #replace(VirtualKey, VirtualValue)}, and {@link #remove(VirtualKey)}
 * can be used as a fast and convenient way to read, add, modify, or delete the corresponding leaf nodes and
 * internal nodes. Indeed, you <strong>MUST NOT</strong> modify the tree structure directly, only
 * through the map-like methods.
 *
 * @param <K>
 * 		The key. Must be a {@link VirtualKey}. It must also be <strong>immutable</strong>.
 * @param <V>
 * 		The value. Must be a {@link VirtualValue}.
