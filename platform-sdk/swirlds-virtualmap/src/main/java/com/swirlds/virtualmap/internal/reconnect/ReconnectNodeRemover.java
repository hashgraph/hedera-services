/**
 * During reconnect, information about all existing nodes is sent from the teacher to the learner. However,
 * the leaner may have old nodes in its virtual tree, and these nodes aren't transferred from the teacher.
 * This class is used to identify such stale nodes in the learner tree. The list of nodes to remove is then
 * used during flushes that happen periodically during reconnects (during hashing).
 *
 * <p>Node remover gets notifications about internal and leaf nodes received from the teacher during reconnect
 * and checks what nodes were in the learner (original) virtual tree at the corresponding paths. For example,
 * if an internal node is received for a path from the teacher, but it was a leaf node on the learner, the
 * key (that corresponds to that leaf) needs to removed. Other cases are handled in a similar way.
 *
 * <p>One particular case is complicated. Assume the learner tree has a key K at path N, and the teacher has
 * the same key at path M, and M &lt; N, while at path N the teacher has a different key L. During reconnects the
 * path M is processed first. At this step, some old key is marked for removal. Some time later path N is
 * processed, and this time key K is marked for removal, but this is wrong as it's still a valid key, just at
 * a different path. To handle this case, during flushes we check all leaf candidates for removal, where in
 * the tree they are located. In the scenario above, when path M was processed, key location was changed from N
 * to M. Later during flush, key K is in the list of candidates to remove, but with path N (this is where it
 * was originally located in the learner tree). Since the path is different, the leaf will not be actually
 * removed from disk.
 *
 * @param <K>
 * 		the type of the key
 * @param <V>
 * 		the type of the value
