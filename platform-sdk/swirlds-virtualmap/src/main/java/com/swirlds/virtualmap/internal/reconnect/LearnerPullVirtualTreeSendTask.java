/**
 * A task running on the learner side, which is responsible for sending requests to the teacher.
 *
 * <p>The very first request to send is for path 0 (virtual root node). A response to this request
 * is waited for before any other requests are sent, because root node response contains virtual
 * tree path range on the teacher side.
 *
 * <p>After the root response has been received, this task keeps sending requests according to
 * the provided {@link NodeTraversalOrder}. After the next path to request is {@link
 * Path#INVALID_PATH}, this request is sent to indicate that there will be no more requests from
 * the learner, and this task is finished.
