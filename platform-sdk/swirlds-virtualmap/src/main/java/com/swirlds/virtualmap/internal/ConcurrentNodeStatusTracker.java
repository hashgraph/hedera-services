 * During reconnect, we have a thread that is sending nodes, and another thread
 * receiving information about the nodes the learner has. We need to keep track
 * of the nodes the learner has notified it knows about, so the sender thread
 * can skip those nodes. Notice that when one node is known by the learner, their
 * descendants are also known. At the moment the teacher receives the notification
 * that the learner has a node, the teacher might have already sent that node,
 * but still any descendant of that node is already known by the learner, and we
 * shouldn't send it or try to send the least possible amount of known nodes.
 * </p>
 * This class keeps track of the status of each node the learner has notified us
 * about. The status is classified as:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>UNKNOWN</strong>: We don't know if the learner knows or doesn't
 *     know about about a node
 *     </li>
 *     <li><strong>KNOWN</strong>: The learner has notified us that it knows
 *     about the node, as well as all of its descendants
 *     </li>
 *     <li><strong>NOT_KNOWN</strong>: The learner has notified us that it
 *     doesn't know about the node, but we can't make any assumption about
 *     the descendants
 *     </li>
 * </ul>

 * This class is thread safe supporting multiple concurrent readers but only
