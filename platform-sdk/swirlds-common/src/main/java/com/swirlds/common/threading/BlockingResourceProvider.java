/**
 * A class that ensures thread safety where multiple providers compete to provide a resource to a single consumer
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The intended use case is multiple providers and a single consumer</li>
 *     <li>All providers should call {@link #acquireProvidePermit()} before providing the resource</li>
 *     <li>The permit will be unavailable until the consumer is blocked waiting for the resource</li>
 *     <li>Once the consumer is waiting, one provider will acquire the permit and can call {@link #provide(Object)}</li>
 *     <li>If the provider cannot provide the resource, it can release the permit for another provider to acquire</li>
 *     <li>Once the provider provides the resource, it will be blocked until the consumer is finished and releases
 *     it</li>
 *     <li>All other providers will not be able to acquire the permit until the process is finished and the consumer
 *     starts waiting again</li>
 * </ul>

 * NOTE: Using this class in any way other than the way described can lead to unintended behaviour
