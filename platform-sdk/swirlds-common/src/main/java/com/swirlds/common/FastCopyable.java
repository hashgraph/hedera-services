     * should do something like copy() on them, too, rather than just copying the reference.
     * <p>
     * Furthermore, the copy operation should be fast, at the possible cost of making reads and writes
     * slower (such as by using some kind of copy-on-write mechanism).
     * <strong>This method causes the object to become immutable and returns a mutable copy.</strong>
     * If the object is already immutable:
     * <ol>
     *     <li>it can throw an MutabilityException</li>
     *     <li>or it can implement a slow, deep copy that returns a mutable object </li>

     *
     * Either behavior is fine, but each implementation should document which behavior it has chosen.
     * By the default, the first implementation is assumed.
     *
     * If a FastCopyable object extends {@link com.swirlds.common.crypto.Hashable} then under no circumstances should
     * the hash be copied by this method.
     *
     * It is strongly suggested that each implementing class override the return type of this method to its self
     * type. So if class Foo extends FastCopyable then Foo's copy signature should look like "public Foo copy()".
