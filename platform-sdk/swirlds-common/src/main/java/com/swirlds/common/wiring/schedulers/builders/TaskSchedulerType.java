     * direct schedulers) to call into a direct scheduler as long as the calling thread is not in a concurrent scheduler
     * or originating from more than one sequential scheduler.

     * To decide if a direct scheduler is wired in a legal way, the following algorithm is used:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Create a directed graph where vertices are schedulers and edges are wires between schedulers</li>
     * <li>Starting from each vertex, walk over the graph in depth first order. Follow edges that lead to
     * DIRECT or DIRECT_THREADSAFE vertices, but do not follow edges that lead into SEQUENTIAL, SEQUENTIAL_THREAD,
     * or CONCURRENT vertices.</li>
     * <li>If a DIRECT vertex is reachable starting from a CONCURRENT vertex, the wiring is illegal.</li>
     * <li>For each vertex with type DIRECT, count the number of unique SEQUENTIAL or SEQUENTIAL_THREAD vertexes that
     * it can be reached by. If that number exceeds 1, then the wiring is illegal.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>
     * These constraints are enforced by the framework.
