/**
 * Configuration for the reconnect.
 *
 * @param active                                 Determines what a node will do when it falls behind. If true, it will
 *                                               attempt a reconnect, if false, it will die. Is reconnect enabled?
 * @param reconnectWindowSeconds                 Defines a window of time after the node starts up when the node is
 *                                               allowed to reconnect. If -1 then a node is always allowed to reconnect.
 *                                               Respects {@link #active} -- if active is false then reconnect is never
 *                                               allowed.
 * @param fallenBehindThreshold                  The fraction of neighbors needed to tell us we have fallen behind
 *                                               before we initiate a reconnect.
 * @param asyncStreamTimeout                     The amount of time that an
 *                                               {@link
 *                                               com.swirlds.common.merkle.synchronization.streams.AsyncInputStream} and
 *                                               {@link
 *                                               com.swirlds.common.merkle.synchronization.streams.AsyncOutputStream}
 *                                               will wait before throwing a timeout.
 * @param asyncOutputStreamFlush                 In order to ensure that data is not languishing in the
 *                                               asyncOutputStream buffer a periodic flush is performed.
 * @param asyncStreamBufferSize                  The size of the buffers for async input and output streams.
 * @param maxAckDelay                            The maximum amount of time to wait for an ACK message. If no ACK is
 *                                               received and sufficient time passes then send the potentially redundant
 *                                               node.
 * @param maximumReconnectFailuresBeforeShutdown The maximum number of failed reconnects in a row before shutdown.
 * @param minimumTimeBetweenReconnects           The minimum time that must pass before a node is willing to help
 *                                               another node to reconnect another time. This prevents a node from
 *                                               intentionally or unintentionally slowing another node down by
 *                                               continuously reconnecting with it. Time is measured starting from when
 *                                               a reconnect attempt is initialized.
 * @param teacherMaxNodesPerSecond               The maximum number of nodes that a teacher will send per second. If 0
 *                                               then there is no limit.
 * @param teacherRateLimiterSleep                The amount of time that a teacher will sleep when throttling is
 *                                               engaged
 * @param pullLearnerRootResponseTimeout         In pull-based reconnect implementations (virtual trees only), the
 *                                               timeout on the learner side to get a virtual root node response from
 *                                               teacher
