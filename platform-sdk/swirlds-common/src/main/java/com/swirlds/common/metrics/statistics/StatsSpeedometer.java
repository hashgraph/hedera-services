// derivation of the formulas in update():
// if only update(n) is called (not cycle), and if it is always called
// exactly once a second since the start, then exponential weighting would be:
// cyclesPerSecond = gamma * cyclesPerSecond + (1-gamma) * n
// It is easy to verify that if we want a half life of halfLife seconds, we use:
// gamma = Math.pow(0.5, 1 / halfLife)
// If we have skipped calling update() for the last dt seconds,
// each of which should have been calls to update(0), but
// those calls weren't made, then calling update(n) now should do:
// cyclesPerSecond = Math.pow(gamma, dt) * cyclesPerSecond + (1-gamma) * n
// Suppose the calls to update(n) aren't once a second, but are K times a second.
// Then we should multiply all 3 variables (dt, halfLife, n) by K. Plugging
// gamma into the first equation, and taking the limit as K goes to infinity gives:
// cyclesPerSecond = Math.pow(0.5, dt / halfLife) * cyclesPerSecond + ln2 / halfLife * n
// which is the formula used in the function above.
// The other formula (during startup) is simpler. If cyclesPerSecond is the average
// cycle calls per second during the first t1 seconds, then multiplying it by t1 gives the count
// of cycle calls up to then. Adding numCycles gives the count up to now. Dividing by t2 gives
// the average per second up to now. So the first formula is the un-weighted average. The
// if statement switches between them as soon as the weight on numCycles for un-weighted
// drops below the weight for weighted.
