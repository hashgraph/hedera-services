/**
 * <p>
 * An object that can be reserved and released. Number of reservations and releases are tracked via a reference count.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An important paradigm to understand with this interface and with classes that implement this interface are
 * "implicit reservations" and "explicit reservations".
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an object is initially constructed, it is considered to have an implicit reservation. Even though
 * its reservation count is 0, we don't want to garbage collect it -- as presumably the caller of the constructor
 * still needs the object. The reservation count of an object with an implicit reservation is 0. Calling
 * {@link #release()} on an object with an implicit reservation will cause that object to be destroyed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When an object with an implicit reservation has {@link #reserve()} called on it the first time, that reservation
 * becomes explicit and has a reservation count of 1. After this point in time, the reservation remains explicit
 * until the object is eventually destroyed. It is impossible for an object with an explicit reservation to
 * return to having an implicit reservation. If at any time after the object obtains an explicit reservation it
 * has {@link #release()} called enough times to reduce its reference count to 0, then that object is destroyed
 * and has its reference count set to -1.
