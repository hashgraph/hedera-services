## Design & Architecture

This section should give an answer to the question: "How will this proposal be implemented?"

This is one of the core sections of the proposal and should be detailed.
All subtitled sections are optional and can be removed if not applicable.
Please structure the content in a way that is easy to read and understand for a broad audience.
A minimal proposal must have a "Design & Architecture" section without any sub-sections.
In any case the section must give a detailed answer to the question: "How will this proposal be implemented?"

### Architecture and/or Components

Describe any new or modified components or architectural changes. This includes thread management changes, state
changes, disk I/O changes, platform wiring changes, etc. Include diagrams of architecture changes.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Module Organization and Repositories

Describe any new or modified modules or repositories.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Core Behaviors

Describe any new or modified behavior. What are the new or modified algorithms and protocols? Include any diagrams that
help explain the behavior.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Public API

Describe any public API changes or additions. Include stakeholders of the API.

Examples of public API include:

* Anything defined in protobuf
* Any functional API that is available for use outside the module that provides it.
* Anything written or read from disk

Code can be included in the proposal directory, but not committed to the code base.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Configuration

Describe any new or modified configuration.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Metrics

Are there new metrics? Are the computation of existing metrics changing? Are there expected observable metric impacts
that change how someone should relate to the metric?

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Performance

Describe any expected performance impacts. This section is mandatory for platform wiring changes.

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Migration

Describe the migration path for existing usage.
What changes are needed to upgrade from the current state to the new state?

Remove this section if not applicable.

## Test Plan

Remove this section if not applicable.

### Unit Tests
