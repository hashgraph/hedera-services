# Lifecycle management for the State

## Summary

This proposal describes a possible implementation of state lifecycle management that could work equally well for both the Consensus Node and the Block Node.

## Purpose and Context

There is an initiative to create self-contained State modules (`swirlds-state-api` and `swirlds-state-impl`) that would have minimal dependencies, and specifically, they should not depend on `swirlds-platform-core`. Part of this initiative is the implementation of a state lifecycle management mechanism that could be used by both the Consensus Node and the Block Node.

### Requirements

- Add an interface representing state lifecycle management and its implementation.
- Update the current State API to be coherent with this State Lifecycle API.
- Implement this set of APIs and migrate the existing code to use it.

## Design & Architecture

### Java classes

- `com.swirlds.state.State` has the following lifecycle-related methods:
  - `State copy()`: creates a copy of the state, which is mutable. The source of the copy becomes immutable.
  - `void computeHash()`: computes the hash of the immutable state.
  - `void createSnapshot(Path targetPath)`: creates a snapshot of the state at the specified path.
  - `State loadSnapshot(Path sourcePath)`: loads the snapshot from the specified path.

These methods correspond to the state lifecycle as follows:

[![State lifecycle](state-lifecycle.svg)](state-lifecycle.svg)

Note that the `loadSnapshot` method doesn't really belong to `com.swirlds.state.State`, as it's a method of the class, and in some cases, we may need to load the snapshot before we have an instance of the state. This method should be moved.

- `SwirldStateManager` needs refactoring. The current implementation has two sets of responsibilities:
  - Keeping track of the references to the latest immutable state and the latest mutable state. This includes creating a copy of the state and updating the references.
  - Handling Platform-related events:
    - Handling consensus rounds.
    - Sealing consensus rounds.
    - Keeping the `freeze time` parameter up-to-date.
    - Providing state for signing.
    - Initializing the state by extracting it from the signed state.

These two sets of responsibilities should be separated. The `swirlds-state-impl` should not have any details related to the platform. However, it should provide all necessary levers for the platform to interact with the state and its lifecycle.

Therefore, `swirlds-state-impl` needs a `StateManager` class that will have the following responsibilities:
- Keeping track of the references to the latest immutable state and the latest mutable state.
- Tracking states that existed before the latest immutable state. These should be available for lookup by their round number.
- Evicting old states that are no longer needed.
- Loading snapshots from the disk.

Additionally, there should be a configuration parameter that limits the number of states kept in memory. When the limit is reached, the oldest state should be evicted.

The interface should look as follows:

```java
public interface StateManager {
    State getLatestImmutableState();
    
    State getLatestMutableState();
    
    State getState(long round);
    
    void evictState(long round);
    
    State loadSnapshot(Path sourcePath);
}
```

Note that the loaded snapshot should be treated as one of the immutable states and should be available via `getState`.

### Metrics

We need to monitor the number of states that are kept in memory to ensure there is no memory leak.

### Performance impact

There is only one important performance considerationâ€”the number of states that are kept in memory. However, this can be mitigated by the configuration parameter that limits the number of states kept in memory. In the absence of this parameter, it should be carefully tested and monitored to prevent memory leaks.

## Testing

This functionality should be covered by a combination of unit tests and integration tests. Additionally, we need to ensure that no functionality is broken after refactoring `SwirldStateManager` and replacing it with `StateManager`.
