# Swirlds Platform Wiki

This document contains information about the Swirlds Platform. It is currently a work in progress.

The platform code is split into three categories:

- Base: common utilities and libraries; logging, configuration, metrics, etc.
- Core: gossip, consensus, data flow, and various algorithms
- Data: merkle data structures for holding the ledger state

## Base

This code is maintained by the "Platform Base" team.

- [Configuration](./base/configuration/configuration.md)
- [Context](./base/context/context.md)
- [Metrics](./base/metrics/metrics.md)
    - Prometheus
    - [Busy time metrics](base/metrics/metric-types/busy-time-metric.md)
- Logging
- Thread Management
- [Test Support](./base/test-support/test-support.md)

## Core
