/**
 * A simple implementation of the {@code LogHandler} interface that stores log events in memory.
 *
 * <p>
 * The {@code InMemoryHandler} class is a basic log handler that keeps a record of log events
 * in an in-memory list. It implements the {@code LogHandler} interface to provide a simple way
 * to capture and retrieve log events during the application's execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each log event accepted by this handler is added to an internal list. You can later retrieve
 * the stored log events using the {@code getEvents} method, which returns an unmodifiable list
 * of log events.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this handler does not provide any advanced logging capabilities, such as log rotation,
 * persistence, or remote logging. It is primarily intended for debugging and testing purposes
 * where you need to capture log events in memory for inspection.
 * </p>
