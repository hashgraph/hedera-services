     * Simulate a turtle network for 5 minutes.
     * <p>
     * This test needs to remain disabled until the following things are resolved:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>We need validation. No point in running a test if you can't validate if it is a pass/fail.</li>
     *     <li>We need to work out the proper place for these tests in the CI lifecycle. TURTLE tests are long for a
     *         unit test, so we need to be careful where we run them.</li>
     *     <li>We need to ensure that all resources used by TURTLE are properly freed up after the test is run.
     *         Currently turtle leaves a bunch of junk on the file system.</li>
     *     <li>We need safeguards/detection against test deadlock. These tests are sufficiently complex as to make
     *         deadlocks a real possibility, and so it would be good to make the framework handle deadlocks.</li>
