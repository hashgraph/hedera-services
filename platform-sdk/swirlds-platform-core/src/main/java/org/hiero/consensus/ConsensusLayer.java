/**
 * The public API of the consensus layer. The consensus layer is responsible for producing rounds consisting of

 * {@link ConsensusLayerInputs} for construction. The consensus layer is owned and driven by the execution layer.
 *
 * <p>The consensus layer produces consensus rounds on demand via {@link #requestNextRound(Roster, Instant)}. There is
 * no backpressure mechanism, however there are internal protections to prevent it from consuming too many resources. A
 * struggling consensus layer will simply take longer to produce the requested round(s).

     * it is ready via {@link ExecutionLayerCallbacks#onRound(Round)}.
     *
     * <p>Calling this method causes more events to be added to the consensus algorithm. It will continue to feed
     * events into the consensus algorithm until the next round (or rounds) reach consensus. Then it will stop feeding
     * it events. No rounds are buffered except for any that reach consensus simultaneously. If buffering rounds is
     * desired, the execution layer must buffer them itself by eagerly requesting the next round. This method can be
     * called multiple times even before the next round is ready. A round will be produced for each invocation of this
     * method.
     *
     * <p>When requesting the next round, the execution layer can provide a new roster to be adopted at a deterministic
     * number of rounds in the future. A {@code null} roster value means that there is no new roster to adopt. The
     * roster used to calculate each consensus round is available via {@link Round#getConsensusRoster()}. This
     * functionality is not yet implemented. It will be completed as part of the final phase of dynamic address book.
     *
     * <p>The freeze time informs the consensus layer of the next desired freeze time. A value of {@code null}
     * indicates that there is no freeze time, and any previously specified freeze time should be cleared (unless the
     * freeze time has already been reached, in which case the freeze time cannot be cleared). Once the consensus round
     * that causes the freeze time to be reached or passed according to consensus time is produced, the consensus layer
     * will begin the freeze process. All future requests for new rounds will be ignored.

     * {@link #sendQuiescenceCommand(QuiescenceCommand)} with the {@link QuiescenceCommand#QUIESCE} value or call
