/**
 * Deduplicates events.
 * <p>
 * A duplicate event is defined as an event with an identical descriptor and identical signature to an event that has
 * already been observed.
 * <p>
 * It is necessary to consider the signature bytes when determining if an event is a duplicate, not just the descriptor
 * or hash. This guards against a malicious node gossiping the same event with different signatures, or a node gossiping
 * another node's event with a modified signature. If we went only off the descriptor or hash, we might discard the
 * correct version of an event as a duplicate, because a malicious version has already been received. Instead, the
 * deduplicator lets all versions of the event through that have a unique descriptor/signature pair, and the signature
 * validator further along the pipeline will handle discarding bad versions.
