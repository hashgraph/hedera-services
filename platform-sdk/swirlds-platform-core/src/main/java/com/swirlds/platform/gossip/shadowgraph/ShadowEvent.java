 * A shadow event wraps a hashgraph event, and provides parent pointers to shadow events.
 *
 * The shadow event type is the vertex type of the shadow graph. This is the elemental type of {@link Shadowgraph}.
 * It provides a reference to a hashgraph event instance and the following operations:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>linking of a parent shadow event</li>
 * <li>unlinking of a parent shadow event</li>
 * <li>querying for parent events</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * All linking and unlinking of a shadow event is implemented by this type.

 * A shadow event never modifies the fields in a hashgraph event.
