 * A map-like object whose keys have an associated sequence number. Multiple keys may have the same sequence number.

 *
 * <p>
 * The sequence number of any particular object in this data structure is not permitted to change.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This data structure is designed around use cases where the sequence number of new objects trends upwards over time.
 * This data structure may be significantly less useful for use cases where the window of allowable
 * sequence numbers shifts backwards and forwards arbitrarily.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This data structure manages the allowed window of sequence numbers. That is, it allows a minimum sequence number
 * and a capacity to be specified, and ensures that entries that violate that window are removed and not allowed
 * to enter. Increasing the minimum value allowed in the window is also called "purging", as it may cause values in the
 * map to be removed if they fall outside the window.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This data structure also allows all values with a particular sequence number to be efficiently
 * retrieved and deleted.
