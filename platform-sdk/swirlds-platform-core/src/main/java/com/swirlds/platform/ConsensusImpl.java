/**
 * All the code for calculating the consensus for events in a hashgraph. This calculates the
 * consensus timestamp and consensus order, according to the hashgraph consensus algorithm.
 *
 * <p>Every method in this file is private, except for some getters and the addEvent method.
 * Therefore, if care is taken so that only one thread at a time can be in the call to addEvent,
 * then only one thread at a time will be anywhere in this is class (except for the getters). None
 * of the variables are volatile, so calls to the getters by other threads may not see effects of
 * addEvent immediately.
 *
 * <p>The consensus order is calculated incrementally: each time a new event is added to the
 * hashgraph, it immediately finds the consensus order for all the older events for which that is
 * possible. It uses a fundamental theorem that was not included in the tech report. That theorem
 * is:
 *
 * <p>Theorem: If every known witness in round R in hashgraph A has its fame decided by A, and
 * S_{A,R} is the set of known famous witnesses in round R in hashgraph A, and if at least one event
 * created in round R+2 is known in A, then S_{A,R} is immutable and will never change as the
 * hashgraph grows in the future. Furthermore, any consistent hashgraph B will have an S_{B,R} that
 * is a subset of S_{A,R}, and as B grows during gossip, it will eventually be the case that S_{B,R}
 * = S_{A,R} with probability one.
 *
 * <p>Proof: the R+2 event strongly sees more than 2/3 of members having R+1 witnesses that vote NO
 * on the fame of any unknown R event X that will be discovered in the future. Any future R+2 voter
 * will strongly see a (possibly) different set of more than 2/3 of the R+1 population, and the
 * intersection of the two sets will all be NO votes for the new voter. So the new voter will see
 * less than 1/3 YES votes, and more than 1/3 NO votes, and will therefore vote no. Therefore every
 * R+3 voter will see unanimous NO votes, and will decide NO. Therefore X will not be famous. So the
 * set of famous in R will never grow in the future. (And so the consensus theorems imply that B
 * will eventually agree).
 *
 * <p>In other words, you never know whether new events and witnesses will be added to round R in
 * the future. But if all the known witnesses in that round have their fame decided (and if a round
 * R+2 event is known), then you know for sure that there will never be any more famous witnesses
 * discovered for round R. So you can safely calculate the received round and consensus time stamp
 * for every event that will have a received round of R. This is the key to the incremental
 * algorithm: as soon as all known witnesses in R have their fame decided (and there is at least one
 * R+2 event), then we can decide the consensus for a new batch of events: all those with received
 * round R.
 *
 * <p>There will be at least one famous event in each round. This is a theorem in the tech report,
 * but both the theorem and its proof should be adjusted to say the following:
 *
 * <p>Definition: a "voter" is a witness in round R that is strongly seen by at least one witness in
 * round R+1.
 *
 * <p>Theorem: For any R, there exists a witness X in round R that will be famous, and this will be
 * decided at the latest when one event in round R+3 is known.
 *
 * <p>Proof: Each voter in R+1 strongly sees more than 2n/3 witnesses in R, therefore each witness
 * in R is on average strongly seen by more than 2n/3 of the voters in R+1. There must be at least
 * one that is not below average, so let X be an R witness that is strongly seen by more than 2n/3
 * round R+1 voters. Those voters will vote YES on the fame of X, because they see X. Any round R+2
 * witness will receive votes from more than 2n/3 round R+1 voters, therefore it will receive a
 * majority of its votes for X being YES, therefore it will either vote or decide YES. If any R+2
 * witness decides, then X is known to be famous at that time. If none do, then as soon as an R+3
 * witness exists, it will see unanimous YES votes, and it will decide YES. So X will be known to be
 * famous after the first witness of R+3 is known (or earlier).
 *
 * <p>In normal operation, with everyone online and everyone honest, we might expect that all of the
 * round R witnesses will be known to be famous after the first event of round R+2 is known. But
 * even in the worst case, where some computers are down (even honest ones), and many dishonest
 * members are forking, the theorem still guarantees at least one famous witness is known by R+3.
 *
 * <p>It is another theorem that the d12 and d2 algorithm have more than two thirds of the
 * population creating unique famous witnesses (judges) in each round. It is a theorem that d1 does,
 * too, for the algorithmn described in 2016, and is conjectured to be true for the 2019 version,
 * too.
 *
 * <p>Another new theorem used here:
 *
 * <p>Theorem: If a new witness X is added to round R, but at least one already exists in round R+2,
 * then X will not be famous (so there is no need to hold the elections).
 *
 * <p>Proof: If an event X currently exists in round R+2, then when the new event Y is added to
 * round R, it won't be an ancestor of X, nor of the witnesses that X strongly sees. Therefore, X
 * will collect unanimous votes of NO for the fame of Y, so X will decide that Y is not famous.
 * Therefore, once a round R+2 event is added to the hashgraph, the set of possible unique famous
 * witnesses for round R is fixed, and the unique famous witnesses will end up being a subset of it.
 *
 * <p>NOTE: for concision, all of the above talks about things like "2/3 of the members" or "2/3 of
 * the witnesses". In every case, it should be interpreted to actually mean "members whose stake
 * adds up to more than 2/3 of the total stake", and "witnesses created by members whose stake is
 * more than 2/3 of the total".
