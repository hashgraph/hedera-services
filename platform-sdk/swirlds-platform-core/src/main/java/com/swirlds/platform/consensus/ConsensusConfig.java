/**
 * Configuration for the consensus algorithm
 *
 * @param roundsNonAncient The number of consensus rounds that are defined to be non-ancient. There can be more
 *                         non-ancient rounds, but these rounds will not have reached consensus. Once consensus is
 *                         reached on a new round (i.e.,fame is decided for all its witnesses), another round will
 *                         become ancient. Events, whose generation is older than the last non-ancient round generation,
 *                         are ancient. If they don't have consensus yet, they're stale, and will never reach consensus
 *                         and never have their transactions handled. Must not exceed the constant
 *                         {@link MinimumJudgeInfo#MAX_MINIMUM_JUDGE_INFO_SIZE}.
 * @param roundsExpired    Events this many rounds old are expired, and can be deleted from memory
 * @param coinFreq         a coin round happens every coinFreq rounds during an election (every other one is all true)
