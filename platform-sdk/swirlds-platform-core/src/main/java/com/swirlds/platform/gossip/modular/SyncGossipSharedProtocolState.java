/**
 * Temporary class made as a side effect of refactoring of SyncGossip
 * Contains all the pieces of state which are accessed between various protocols
 * For each of them, reasonable solution has to be found, how to wire it properly (either through rest of the system, or reduce dependency on shared state between the protocols)
 *
 * @param networkMetrics        metrics to register data about communication traffic and latencies
 * @param syncPermitProvider    manages sync permits, to avoid spamming too many operations at once
 * @param shadowgraph           mirror copy of all the events
 * @param syncManager           who we need to sync with, and whether we need to reconnect
 * @param gossipHalted          flag to stop gossip when reconnection
 * @param shadowgraphExecutor   reference to shadowgraph thread to be started by controller
 * @param currentPlatformStatus used to tell gossip the status of the platform
 * @param receivedEventHandler  output wiring to call when event is received from neighbour
 * @param fallenBehindCallback  callback to run on first case of falling behind, to initialize reconnection threads
