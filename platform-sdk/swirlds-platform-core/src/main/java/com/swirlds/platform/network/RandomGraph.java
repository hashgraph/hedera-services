/**
 * A connected undirected graph with N vertices, each of degree K (each has edges to exactly K others). The graph is
 * generated pseudorandomly from a seed S, so a given (S,N,K) triplet will always generate the same graph. Furthermore,
 * for any given S and K, it is designed to work so that the graph for N and the graph for N+1 are as similar as
 * possible.
 * <p>
 * This generates the matrix in O(N^4) expected time. On a laptop (2016 MacBook Pro), N=1000 took 0.08 seconds. The
 * timing curve from N=0 to N=1000 was very close to a cubic (R^2 value of 0.9994). The time to generate the graph of N
 * vertices (in seconds) was about:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 5.115057698588E-10 * N ^ 3
 * 		+ 5.558555628707E-08 * N ^ 2
 * 				+ 4.810047522830E-06 * N
 * 				- 7.749551593009E-05
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The current algorithm is to generate an N-vertex graph by first generating the clique of D+1 vertices, then adding
 * new vertices one at a time until there are N vertices. When there are V vertices (V>=D+1), vertex number V+1 is added
 * by creating the new vertex, randomly choosing D/2 disjoint edges from the existing graph (so no two of them share a
 * vertex), adding edges between the new vertex and all D of the vertices connected to those edges, and deleting those
 * edges. This ensures the new vertex has D edges. And each of the D modified vertices lose one edge and gain one edge,
 * which maintains their total degree at D. Furthermore, the graphs for N and for N+1 vertices are very similar, because
 * only D of the existing vertices are changed, and they are only changed by a single edge deletion and addition.
 * <p>
 * Does the algorithm always halt? Does there always exist a set of D/2 disjoint edges at each step? Yes, and yes. It
 * will not get stuck while trying to select D/2 disjoint edges. The proof is to consider selecting the edges one at a
 * time, and at each step marking the two vertices that the edge connects, and also marking every edge connected to
 * either of those two vertices. Even after D/2-1 edges have been selected, there will still exist at least one unmarked
 * edge to select. In fact, every unmarked vertex will have at least 2 unmarked edges. That is because, at this
 * penultimate step, only D-2 vertices have been marked, and so each unmarked vertex has at most D-2 edges marked (which
 * are those edges connecting to the D-2 marked vertices). Since each unmarked vertex has D edges, there must be at
 * least 2 that are unmarked. So there will certainly be edges available to choose, and so the algorithm will not become
 * stuck. A maximum independent set of edges can be found in polynomial time by the Blossom Algorithm, but the simple,
 * greedy algorithm used here solves an easier problem: find D independent edges in a regular graph of degree D.
