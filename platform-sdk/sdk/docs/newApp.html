<h1>How to create a new Swirlds app in Eclipse</h1>
These versions (or later) should be downloaded and installed:
<ul>
	<li>Oracle Java SE 10: <a
			href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase10-4425482.html">
		Oracle Java SE Development Kit 10.0.2</a></li>

	<li>Eclipse 4.7 (Oxygen):
		<a href="https://eclipse.org/downloads/">Eclipse IDE for Java Developers</a> (EE is also ok).
	</li>

	<li> Swirlds SDK: <a href="http://www.swirlds.com/download/">Swirlds SDK</a>.</li>

</ul>

To create a new app, copy the <b>HelloSwirldsDemo</b> folder and everything in it to a new folder with the appropriate
name. In this example, the new folder will be called <b>ExampleApp</b>. The folder can be anywhere, but there are some
advantages to having it somewhere under the Eclipse <b>workspace</b> directory. Two directory levels above
<b>ExampleApp</b> will be the Swirlds browser (named <b>swirlds.jar</b>) and possibly a file named <b>config.txt</b> In
this example, the files will be at:<br>
<pre>
    workspace/git/swirlds/sdk/source/ExampleApp
    workspace/git/swirlds/sdk/swirlds.jar
    workspace/git/swirlds/sdk/config.txt
</pre>

This example will use slashes in paths, but on Windows they will be backslashes. After copying and renaming the folder,
do the following:<p>

<ul>
	<li> edit the file <b>ExampleApp/pom.xml</b> with a text editor</li>
	<ul>
		<li> replace all 3 occurrences of "HelloSwirldDemo" with "ExampleApp"</li>
		<li> save and close the text editor</li>
	</ul>

	<li>
		import the project
		<ul>
			<li>run Eclipse</li>
			<li> if the package explorer isn't visible, choose menu WINDOW > SHOW VIEW > PROJECT EXPLORER</li>
			<li> choose menu FILE > IMPORT</li>
			<li> click the triangle by MAVEN if it doesn't have items indented under it</li>
			<li> click EXISTING MAVEN PROJECTS</li>
			<li> click NEXT</li>
			<li> click BROWSE (on the same line as ROOT DIRECTORY)</li>
			<li> navigate to the <b>ExampleApp</b> folder, and click on it
			<li> click OPEN</li>
			<li> click FINISH</li>
			<li> in the package explorer, click the triangle by EXAMPLEAPP then SRC then (DEFAULT PACKAGE) to open
				them
			</li>
			<li> right click on <b>HelloSwirldDemoMain.java</b> and choose REFACTOR > RENAME</li>
			<li> change the name to <b>ExampleAppMain</b>
			<li> make sure the first box is checked (UPDATE REFERENCES) and the other two are unchecked</li>
			<li> click FINISH twice (because it will warn there is a main method)</li>
			<li> do the same to rename <b>HelloFileSystemDemoState</b> to <b>ExampleAppState</b></li>
		</ul>

	<li> in the package explorer, right click on <b>pom.xml</b> and choose RUN AS > MAVEN INSTALL</li>
	<li> click on <b>src</b> in the package explorer to select it</li>
	<li> click the green arrow button on the top bar to run it</li>
	<li> if it asks, click JAVA APPLICATION and click OK</li>
</ul>

If there is a config.txt file in the same directory as swirlds.jar, then the new ExampleApp should run. It should look
exactly like the HelloSwirldDemo app. If there are any problems, see <a href="runBrowser.html">How To Run Apps</a>.
<p>
<p>
	At this point, the new app is ready for code development.
