<h1>How to run apps in the Swirlds browser</h1>

<h2>Install Java and Swirlds</h2>
The Swirlds browser needs both the Java runtime and the Swirlds SDK to be installed. This can be done by following the
instructions for either

<a href="installEclipse.html">installing with Eclipse</a> or
<a href="installCLI.html">installing with Maven</a>. To simply run the apps without creating new apps, there is no need
to install Eclipse or Maven. It is sufficient to just follow the installation instructions for the Java SDK and the JCE
security policy file.
<p>

	The browser is the file <b>swirlds.jar</b>. Both <b>swirlds.jar</b> and the <b>data</b> directory should be in the
	same directory, along with an optional <b>config.txt</b> file. The subdirectory <b>data/apps</b> will contain all of
	the apps that the browser can run, each in its own <b>.jar</b> file.
<p>

<h2>Prepare for random numbers</h2>
The Swirlds browser uses the same encryption technology that is used by a web browser when it goes to a secure HTTPS://
website. In both cases, there is a need to get random numbers from the operating system. This works fine for most
operating systems, such as Windows, MacOS, and Linux. However, some operating systems may need to be configured to
generate good random numbers. If the Swirld browser seems to freeze when launched, it may need extra software to be
installed to help the operating system collect entropy (randomness). If that case, download whatever utilities are
appropriate for the particular operating system, such as those for
<a href="installDebian.html">Debian</a>
or
<a href="installRaspbian.html">Raspbian</a>


<h2>Run the Swirlds browser</h2>

Double click on the <b>swirlds.jar</b> file to run an app. (On a Mac, the first time you run it, you may need to right
click on it and choose OPEN). You can also run it from the command line by going into the swirlds directory and
typing:</p>

<pre>java -jar swirlds.jar</pre>

Future versions of the browser will have a window interface to let the user launch apps and connect to existing
networks. The current version supports another method for controlling it, the <b>config.txt</b> file. The
<b>config.txt</b> file that comes with the SDK has comments in it explaining how to control which app will run, and how
to pass it parameters. It can also control how many instances will run, and which computers they will run on. It can
even run multiple instances on the same machine, communicating with each other through TCP/IP as if they were on
different machines.

<h2>Use the SDK to develop and run new apps</h2>

After downloading and installing the SDK as above, developers can <a href="newApp.html">write new apps</a> that run in
the Swirlds browser.
