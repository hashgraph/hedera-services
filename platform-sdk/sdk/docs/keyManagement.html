<h1>Key Management</h1>
The Swirlds platform uses cryptographic keys to perform encryption and digital signatures, and to enable TLS protection
of the communication between computers. It supports various methods to manage those keys. Two key management methods
currently exist, and more will be added in the future. The existing methods are described below.

<h2>Default keys</h2>
In this option, every computer in the network is provisioned with a <b>config.txt</b> file, but not with any key files.
That means the /sdk/data/keys directory contains no *.pfx files. <p>

	In this case, the browser creates all the keys deterministically. This provides no security, because the keys are
	always the same. But it can be useful for things such as keeping firewalls from analyzing the information being sent
	through them.

<h2>Key files</h2>
In this option, a single person generates all the keys to be used by all the computers running this network. If the
network will have three computers (full nodes), named Alice, Bob, and Carol, then the keys can be generated by modifying
and running the script in the sdk/data/keys directory. On Linux and MacOS, this is done by typing this on the command
line:

<pre>     ./generate.sh</pre>

On Windows, this is typed into the command line console:

<pre>     generate.bat</pre>

Before running the script, it must be edited. There is one line near the top containing a list of names. That should be
changed to match all the names that are in the config.txt file. The names should all have their uppercase letters
changed to lowercase, and should have removed all their accents, spaces, and punctuation. So for this example, the list
wouldn't be ("Alice" "Bob" "Carol"), but would actually need to be ("alice" "bob" "carol"). A name like "5- John
O'Donald, Sr." in the config.txt would need to be listed as "5johnodonaldsr" in the script. And if the "o" had an umlaut
above it or a grave accent above it in the config.txt, then it would need to be entered as a plain "o" in the script.<p>
	å

	For the Windows generate.bat script, there is also a line near the top for JAVA_HOME. This
	needs to be changed to match the location on the hard drive that the JDK was installed.
	This can be found by searching for Java in the search box at the top of any folder
	window.
<p>

	The scripts use the Oracle keytool program that is installed when Java is installed. In this example, the script
	will use it to create these files:

<pre>
     public.pfx
     private-alice.pfx
     private-bob.pfx
     private-carol.pfx
</pre>

These are created on a single computer, when someone runs the script. They must then put these two files into the
sdk/data/keys directory on Alice's computer:

<pre>
     public.pfx
     private-alice.pfx
</pre>

Similarly, the files public.pfx and private-bob.pfx must be put into the skd/data/keys directory on Bob's computer. And
similarly for Carol's computer. Then the original three files should be deleted.<p>

	At this point, all three computers can start the browser, and run the app. All three computers will communicate to
	each other with strong encryption, to prevent eavesdroppers from knowing what they are communicating. They will also
	sign all their messages with strong digital signatures, to prevent attackers from forging messages in their name.
<p>

	All communication is encrypted with TLS 1.2, with algorithms and key sizes chosen to conform to the Commercial
	National Security Algorithm Suite
	<a href="https://www.iad.gov/iad/library/ia-guidance/ia-solutions-for-classified/algorithm-guidance/commercial-national-security-algorithm-suite-factsheet.cfm">(CNSA
		suite)</a>, using the Java 8 cipher suite TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384. That is the standard the US
	government requires for protecting top secret information. This is intended to provide good security, but there are
	several issues to keep in mind to make it secure.
<p>

	The private-*.pfx files contain the private keys. If the attacker can get a copy of one of them, then the attacker
	can eavesdrop and forge messages. So each computer must be kept physically secure, and must be protected from any
	virus, worm, malware, insider attack or hacking attack. In addition, it is important to remember that even when
	files are deleted from a hard drive, an attacker may still be able to recover them later. So if a particular hard
	drive has ever held a certain file, even briefly, it should forever be treated as if it still had that file, until
	the drive has been securely erased by overwriting with random bits. Most operating systems have a utility for doing
	that.
<p>

	The public.pfx file does not need to be kept secret. If an attacker obtains a copy of it, the attacker will merely
	learn the names of the members (similar to obtaining a copy of config.txt), but the attacker will not be able to
	eavesdrop or forge messages.
<p>

	Also, of course, the files must be protected as they are moved from the computer where they are created to the
	computers where they are used. Emailing them would not be secure! It is recommended that they be carried from one
	computer to the other using a USB thumb drive. Afterwards, the thumb drive should be securely erased by repeatedly
	overwriting with random bits.
