<h1>Installing Swirlds on Debian</h1>
<p>To make Swirlds work on Debian, it is possible that the hardware random number generator needs to be configured for
	TLS to work</p>

<h2>Setting up the hardware random number generator</h2>
<p>
	If the Swirlds software freezes immediately when it is run, then it is possibly a problem with the entropy
	collection system used by Debian. That might be fixed by doing the following from the command line:
</p>
<pre>
apt-get install haveged
update-rc.d haveged defaults
</pre>
