# Component Framework

The goal of this framework is to provide a structure for defining software components in which:

* Components can be defined in isolation, each with their own unit of business logic.
* Components can be connected (or wired) together with other components to form a data pipeline.
* Each component allows its threading model to be changed individually without modifying the business logic.

These goals allow software to be well organized, flexible, and easily tuned for performance.
