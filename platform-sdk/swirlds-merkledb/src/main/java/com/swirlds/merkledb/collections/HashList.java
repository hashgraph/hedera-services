/**
 * A simple random access list of {@link Hash}es. It acts like a very simple long to {@link Hash} map.
 * Java Collections do not support collections of more than {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} length, whereas this collection
 * does. We do not implement analogs of many of the {@link java.util.Collection} APIs, because they are not needed.
 * The data structure does not contain a {@code size} method, or any explicit control over the size of the data
 * structure, but sub-classes may impose such restrictions.
 *
 * Concurrent reads are supported. Concurrent writes to <strong>different</strong> indexes are also supported. Writes
 * to the same index are <strong>not</strong> atomic, and therefore lead to unpredictable results.
 *
 * This class was designed to support the on-disk merkle database. These concurrency tradeoffs are acceptable
 * because there is only ever one flushing thread writing to the {@link HashList} and no readers will concurrently
 * read from these write locations because those indexes are covered by the in-memory cache.
 *
 * Implementations of {@link HashList} may include off-heap or even on-disk variants. As such, the Hash objects
 * may be serialized to/from bytes.
