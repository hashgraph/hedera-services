/**
 * HalfDiskHashMap buckets are somewhat expensive resources. Every bucket has an
 * underlying byte buffer to store bucket data and metadata, and the number of
 * buckets is huge. This class provides a bucket pool, so buckets can be reused
 * rather than created on every read / write call.
 *
 * <p>Bucket pool is accessed from multiple threads:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Transaction thread, when a key path is loaded from HDHM as a part of
 *     get call</li>
 *     <li>Lifecycle thread, when updated bucket is written to disk in the end
 *     of HDHM flushing</li>
 *     <li>HDHM background bucket reading threads</li>
 *     <li>Warmup (aka prefetch) threads</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>If buckets were created, updated, and then released (marked as available
 * for other threads) on a single thread, this class would be as simple as a
 * single {@link ThreadLocal} object. This is not the case, unfortunately. For
 * example, when HDHM background reading threads read buckets from disk, buckets
 * are requested from the pool by {@link BucketSerializer} as a part of data
 * file collection read call. Then buckets are updated and put to a queue, which
 * is processed on a different thread, virtual pipeline (aka lifecycle) thread.
 * Only after that buckets can be reused. This is why the pool is implemented as
 * an array of buckets with fast concurrent read/write access from multiple
 * threads.
