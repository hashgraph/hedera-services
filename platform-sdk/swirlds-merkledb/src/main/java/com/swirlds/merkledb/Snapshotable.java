     * Snapshots are done in the transaction handler thread, so they have to be synchronized with flushes
     * (running in virtual pipeline thread) and compactions (running in dedicated background threads). To sync
     * up with flushes, this method is run either from VirtualRootNode.detach(), which is called while pipeline
     * is paused, or on learner reconnect, while no data is stored to the virtual map. Synchronization with
     * compaction processes is slightly more complicated. Before virtual map snapshot is started, it takes a
     * lock (semaphore), which is monitored by compaction threads. As soon as the semaphore is locked,
     * compaction is immediately stopped. If compaction thread is in the middle of index update, it updates a
     * single index entry and then stops until the snapshot is done. Compaction thread may also be in the
     * middle of deleting compacted files. In this case, files are deleted first, and snapshot will not take
     * them into consideration.
