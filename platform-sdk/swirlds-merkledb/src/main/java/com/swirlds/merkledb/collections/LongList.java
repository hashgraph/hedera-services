 * A simple, random access list of <b>non-zero</b> longs designed to allow lock-free concurrency
 * control. Unlike a {@link java.util.List}, the size of a {@link LongList} can exceed {@code
 * Integer.MAX_VALUE}.
 *
 * <p>Zero is treated as a sentinel value, marking indexes that have never been used with a {@code
 * put()} call or indexes that no longer contain valid values after a call to {@link #remove}.
 *
 * <p>Implementations should support both concurrent reads and writes. Writing to an index beyond
 * the current capacity of the list (but less than the max capacity) should <b>not</b> fail, but
 * instead trigger an automatic expansion of the list's capacity. Thus a {@link LongList} behaves
 * more like a long-to-long map than a traditional list.
