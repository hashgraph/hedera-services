/**
 * Represents the state of a queue, tracking its head and tail indices.
 *
 * <p><b>Why is it needed?</b></p>
 * This class encapsulates the metadata required for managing a queue, such as its head and tail
 * indices. It provides utilities for serialization, size computation, and determining if the queue
 * is empty. By abstracting this information, the queue's state can be stored, retrieved, and updated
 * effectively, making it integral to on-disk queue implementations.
 *
 * <p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
 * This class:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Tracks the head (next index to retrieve) and tail (next index to add) of the queue.</li>
 *     <li>Determines queue size and whether it is empty.</li>
 *     <li>Handles serialization and deserialization of the queue state for persistence.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Where is it used?</b></p>
 * This class is used in queue implementations that rely on disk-backed storage, such as in
 * conjunction with the {@link com.swirlds.state.merkle.disk.OnDiskQueueHelper}, to persist the state
 * of the queue and manage its metadata.
